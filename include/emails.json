Enron's board cost\r\nthe company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial\r\nOfficer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,\r\npartnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged\r\nWednesday in a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion\r\nin third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street\r\nJournal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the\r\ntwo limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity\r\nby $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the\r\npartnerships, the paper reported yesterday.\r\n\r\n     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John\r\nHancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are\r\nsomeone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to\r\npunt with Enron.''\r\n\r\n     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written\r\nrequests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a\r\ntelephone call for comment.\r\n\r\n     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million\r\nlast year in management fees and about $4 million in capital\r\nincreases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the\r\npartnerships, the Journal reported today.\r\n\r\n                        Buying Enron Assets\r\n\r\n     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and\r\npartnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,\r\nbased on filings with the Texas secretary of state.\r\n\r\n     The foreign business corporations and limited liability\r\ncompanies have directors, officers or managers whose address is\r\nlisted as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,\r\naccording to Texas records.\r\n\r\n     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in\r\neach one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron\r\nassets, including foreign power plants.\r\n\r\n     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing\r\nmember, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use\r\nthe proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other\r\n``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or\r\ncompanies since 1999 and sold four.\r\n\r\n     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about\r\nFastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the\r\nvalue of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company\r\nexecutives at Enron's expense.\r\n\r\n     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05.

In the interest of the stockholders, that CFO should be gone,\" he said. \r\nEnron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. \r\nPOOR JUDGMENT? \r\nAnalysts said that at the very least, the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron, which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August. \r\n\"For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors,\" said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. \"It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron,\" he said. \r\nEnron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year, when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. \r\nThe stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. \r\nThis year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured, Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO, and the company's Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payments dispute. \r\nMoody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non-core businesses, including broadband and water services. \r\nSome of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings. \r\nAnalysts said Enron's credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead. \r\n\"What don't we know that went on at that company? Where's the credibility?\" asked one frustrated analyst. \"We don't know if it's limited to this,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE US)\r\nwas downgraded to ``hold'' from ``buy'' by analyst Michael C Heim at A.G.\r\nEdwards & Sons Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A Beating\r\nBy Michael Rieke\r\n\r\n10/19/2001\r\nDow Jones Energy Service\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nA Dow Jones Newswires Column \r\n\r\nHOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) hype and skyrocketing share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business.\r\nNow investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom. \r\nThe company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the third quarter of last year, the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 million. \r\nEnron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included severance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs, loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enron's content services. \r\nAt an analysts meeting Oct. 16, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is \"not that robust\" right now. Industry revenue is low and there's substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market, \"more than even we anticipated,\" Lay said. \r\nThe company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners. \r\n\"A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into,\" he said. \"Others thought so, too.\" \r\nLooking back, Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital, Lay said. It spent \"too much too soon.\" \r\nAn Ominous Comparison \r\n\r\nHe compared Enron's move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won't be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron. \r\nAzurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadband in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-lasting headache than broadband. \r\nMaybe Enron's surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers. \r\nIt's trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year, he said. It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business. \r\nMeanwhile, the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in, he said. \r\nEnron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs. \r\nAt one time, they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard, Whalley said. Now they \"wouldn't want to forever be in the network business.\" \r\nBoth executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets. \r\nThe one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation. \"Intermediation\" is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses, said an Enron spokeswoman. It's a combination of trading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers. \r\nMore Bad News Expected \r\n\r\nRebecca Followill, a research analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter. \r\n\"If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen, you've got to figure that their assets' values have fallen similarly,\" Followill told Bandwidth Beat. \"I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in broadband.\" \r\nAnother analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron. \"To the extent that they can take more writedowns, I think it would make eminently good sense to do it.\" \r\nHe predicted \"a $200 million haircut\" in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue. \r\nAnd that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broadband property, plant and equipment at the end of last year, he said. They had another $600 million of risk management asset receivables, inventories and working capital items. \r\nFollowill doesn't see much future in broadband for Enron. \r\n\"I think the business will shrink to the point where it won't be shown as a key sector in their reporting,\" she said. \r\nEnron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds, she said. Her investor clients don't expect broadband to contribute to Enron's earnings within the next three years. \r\nShe thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy. \r\nThe other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. \"It doesn't look like there's any right now, to be honest,\" he said. \"They'll carry the trading operation to some degree.\" \r\n-By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.com\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth sector has reached its bottom and is recovering. \r\nBut those critics don't understand his bandwidth business, Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don't understand how the business world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said.\r\nIn announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday, Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year. \r\nBusinesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event, be it of natural or human origin. That's what's driving the recovery, he said. \r\nAlso, businesses will avoid travel, he said, relying instead on video conferencing. \r\nEnron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn't seen any signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering, in part, because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with, he said. \r\n\"They're trying to find trading partners for broadband,\" Watson said. \"That's going to be tough to do.\" Dynegy isn't concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isn't \"a realistic model\" for it yet, he said. \"I said two years ago it was at least two years away. I still think it's probably at least two years away, before we actually call it a trading commodity.\" \r\nThe metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks, which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity, Watson said. \r\nIt's unfortunate that Enron's model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market, Watson said. Dynegy's model includes telecom contracts, negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply of bandwidth. \r\nDynegy's bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past several months, they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy's customers. The goal has been to build a customer base. \"We're looking at being an intermediary, and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today.\" \r\nSince Dynegy lit its 16,000 route-mile network two weeks ago, the trading desk has been trying to fill the company's network instead of buying bandwidth from others. \"I'm trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements,\" Watson said. \r\nHe pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. \"They have offices that never talked to each before,\" he said. \"Now they've got to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable.\" \r\nChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy, said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids. \r\nThe average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications, the corporation's telecommunications unit, is $20 million to $25 million a quarter, Watson said. In the third quarter, it lost $15 million, down from $20 million in the second quarter. \r\nDynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. \r\n\"If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that's what we need really,\" he said. \"If we can get there by the end of next year, I'll be very happy. I think by '03, this market will have righted itself.\" \r\nWatson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy. \r\n\"Dynegy is an energy company,\" he said. \"Our energy merchant company is doing very well and business is growing like a weed...(Telecommunications) is not our core business by any stretch right now.

As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire,\" Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment group Exchange Consulting said. \r\n\"Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets, people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies.\" \r\nLast week, ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member, unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor, prompting around 25 job losses among traders, phone jockeys and clerks. \r\nThen blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New York base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact, but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process. \r\nIn the same week, the LME's largest floor trader, Enron Metals, said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group . \r\nSECURITY \r\nWith three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time, competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security. \r\n\"What we're finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record, which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they're keen to stay put,\" Gilley said. \r\n\"So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years, they are now staying for three to five years. \r\n\"They probably feel that they're reasonably safe where they are, they're well recognised and not going to stick their necks out,\" she said. \r\nBONUS FEARS \r\nOctober has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences \r\nAlso, traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bonuses, which are usually announced at the end of the year. \r\n\"Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of year, people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don't think any of them are anticipating good bonuses. They're probably just happy to have a job,\" Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said. \r\nLME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi-tech and telecomms stocks. \r\nMetals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients, and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market. \r\nCompanies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal. \r\n\"A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it, \" Gilley said. \r\n\"The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing,\" she added. \r\nAs for morale in the industry, individuals' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed. \r\n\"Just because I've lost my job doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Porsche,\" one trader said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(NPW) expects to meet its prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement with Enron Corp. (ENE), lowering the collateral New Power must post under a master netting agreement. \r\nIn a press release Friday, New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact and cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.\r\nThe company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. \r\nAnalysts put the company's third quarter loss at $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. \r\nThird quarter revenue will be \"slightly lower\" than the $60 million to $65 million forecast in August, New Power said. \r\n\r\nIn the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.19 million. \r\nThe amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the master cross-product netting, setoff, and security agreement, and expands through Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the Enron units. \r\nUnder the amended pact, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. \r\nShares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67, up 1 cent, or 0.6%, on early composite volume of 7,900 shares. Average daily volume is 223,800 shares. \r\n-Bill Platt; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. \r\nThe extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. \r\nEnron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \r\nTen Long Days\r\nEnron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. \r\nThe turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.\r\nEnron's End Run?   \r\nNew financial chief's involvement in Enron business partners\r\nEnron-Related Entity\tCreation DateMcMahon Involved?\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nECT Strategic Value Corp.4/18/1985\tYes\t\t\r\nJILP-LP Inc.\t9/27/1995\tYes\t\r\nECT Investments Inc.\t3/1/1996\tYes\t\r\nKenobe Inc.\t11/8/1996\tYes\t\r\nEnserco LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\r\nObi-1 Holdings LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\r\nOilfield Business Investments1/7/1997\tYes\t\t\r\nHGK Enterprises LP Inc.\t7/29/1997\tYes\t\r\nECT Eocene Enterprises III Inc.2/20/1998Yes\t\t\t\r\nJedi Capital II LLC\t9/4/1998\tYes\t\r\nE.C.T.

The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. \r\nAmong ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. \r\nDemands, Demands\r\nRating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. \r\nIf Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. \r\nFriday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. \r\nThis week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the \"market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets.\" He added: \"It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets.\" \r\nMcMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. \r\n\r\nUnder The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb\r\nBy Christopher Edmonds <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>\r\nSpecial to TheStreet.com\r\n10/26/2001 05:08 PM EDT\r\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/comment/chrisedmonds/10003075.html>\r\n\r\nWhile the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. \r\nWhat's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, \"I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe.\" \r\nPeter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. \r\nThe rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. \r\nNow, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. \r\nThe Company's Challenge\r\nBut what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. \r\n\"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,\" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. \"We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.\" \r\nDietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. \r\nStraightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. \r\nAlthough Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. \r\nThe divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. \r\nThe credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. \r\nFrankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. \"If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Dietert says. \"In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow.\" \r\nIt's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. \r\nThere's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, \"Why? Ask why.\" \r\nInvestors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer. \r\nFirst Things First\r\nMany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week. Thank you for your concern.

ISO New England\r\nspokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its\r\ndefault. \r\n\r\n  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on\r\noccasion, Foley and Doot said. \r\n\r\n  \"I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant\r\nto find itself out of compliance,\" Doot said. \"Those things have in fact\r\nhappened from time to time.\" \r\n\r\n  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\r\n2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)\r\n\r\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\r\n\r\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit\r\nalleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services\r\ncould temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed\r\nInternet service in some U.S. regions.\r\n\r\n     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company\r\nfrom providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron\r\nprovides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in\r\nthe 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.\r\noperates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.\r\n\r\n     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to\r\noffer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to\r\ngive the largest software company access to potential customers in\r\n29 million homes.

Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such\r\nas Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.\r\n\r\n     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who\r\nis suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial\r\nOfficer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at\r\nleast $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder\r\nequity.\r\n\r\n     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives\r\nbenefited financially from roles as officers and directors of\r\npartnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at\r\nleast 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and\r\nemployees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according\r\nto Texas secretary of state records.\r\n\r\n     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests\r\nwill result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next\r\nweek if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron\r\nspokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment\r\nabout the document requests.\r\n\r\n     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron\r\nspokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests\r\nin the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer\r\nsaid. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to\r\nthe boards of affiliates.\r\n\r\n                       Affiliates Have Debts\r\n\r\n     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,\r\nFrevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list\r\ntheir address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as\r\nofficers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign\r\nbusiness corporations.\r\n\r\n     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on\r\nany form of compensation or benefit received from any of the\r\naffiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the\r\nexecutives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the\r\naffiliates.\r\n\r\n     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets\r\nsuch as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron\r\nto move debt associated with those projects off its books.\r\n\r\n     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They\r\nplan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron\r\nmight be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and\r\nthe debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets\r\ndon't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n                            Few Answers\r\n\r\n     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer\r\nKenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a\r\nconference call Tuesday.\r\n\r\n     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to\r\nquestions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.\r\n\r\n     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as\r\nofficers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC.

Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers\r\nhave denied the charges repeatedly.\r\n\r\n     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the\r\npower market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and\r\nother generators are complying with subpoenas for trading\r\ndocuments. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I\r\ndon't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra\r\nMontgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be\r\nseen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.\r\n\r\n     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in\r\nCalifornia soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities\r\ninsolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market\r\nto competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison\r\nInternational weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.\r\n\r\n     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the\r\ncommittee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are\r\nputting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to\r\na speedy resolution.''\r\n\r\n     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half\r\nsince Oct. 16.

'' Lockyer\r\nlater apologized for the remark.\r\n\r\n     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer\r\nspokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know\r\nwhen civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power\r\nproviders might be filed.\r\n\r\n     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We\r\nhad to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that\r\nslowed things down a bit.''\r\n\r\n     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney\r\ngeneral's investigation.\r\n\r\n     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness\r\nto take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his\r\nvulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.\r\n\r\n                           More Lawsuits\r\n\r\n     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke\r\nEnergy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging\r\nthey manipulated California energy prices in violation of\r\nantitrust laws.\r\n\r\n     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the\r\nCity of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz\r\nBustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts\r\nawaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer\r\nrepresenting Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a\r\njudge by the end of next month, he said.\r\n\r\n     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to\r\nrepay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including\r\ntriple damages.\r\n\r\n     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,\r\ndeclining for the eighth day in a row.

The shares fell 95 cents,\r\nor 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.\r\n\r\n     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure\r\ninvestors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors\r\nsaid. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,\r\nwhere short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.\r\n\r\n     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''\r\nsaid John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth\r\nThird Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of\r\nmanagement.''\r\n\r\n      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion\r\nin commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark\r\nPalmer said.\r\n\r\n                            Bonds Drop\r\n\r\n     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1\r\n1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86\r\ncents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''\r\nyield 9.53 percent.\r\n\r\n     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit\r\nrating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses\r\nfrom failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash\r\ndaily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to\r\nsettle transactions.\r\n\r\n     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart\r\nfinancial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's\r\nInvestors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the\r\nhassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and\r\ninsured access to capital.''\r\n\r\n     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their\r\nyield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds\r\nthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies\r\nwith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back\r\nholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value\r\nof Enron investors' stock.\r\n\r\n     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron\r\nassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to\r\nthe partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The\r\npartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n                         Other Liabilities\r\n\r\n     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money\r\ncomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find\r\nthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would\r\nhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell\r\nfor and the amount of the debt.\r\n\r\n     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron\r\npreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would\r\nthin out the holdings of every other investor.\r\n\r\n     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have\r\nEnron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's\r\nlowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones\r\nRating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''\r\none notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''\r\n\r\n     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount\r\nto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.\r\n\r\n     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on\r\nWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a\r\npartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct\r\nlosses.

Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees\r\n\r\n10/26/2001\r\nBusiness Wire\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\r\n\r\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. \r\nThe investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.\r\nOn Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking \"non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,\" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. \r\nIf you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. \r\nSeattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade.

And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. \r\nThe extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. \r\nEnron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \r\nTen Long Days\r\nEnron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. \r\nThe turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.\r\nEnron's End Run?   \r\nNew financial chief's involvement in Enron business partners\r\nEnron-Related Entity\tCreation DateMcMahon Involved?\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nECT Strategic Value Corp.4/18/1985\tYes\t\t\r\nJILP-LP Inc.\t9/27/1995\tYes\t\r\nECT Investments Inc.\t3/1/1996\tYes\t\r\nKenobe Inc.\t11/8/1996\tYes\t\r\nEnserco LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\r\nObi-1 Holdings LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\r\nOilfield Business Investments1/7/1997\tYes\t\t\r\nHGK Enterprises LP Inc.\t7/29/1997\tYes\t\r\nECT Eocene Enterprises III Inc.2/20/1998Yes\t\t\t\r\nJedi Capital II LLC\t9/4/1998\tYes\t\r\nE.C.T.

The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. \r\nAmong ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. \r\nDemands, Demands\r\nRating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. \r\nIf Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. \r\nFriday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. \r\nThis week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the \"market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets.\" He added: \"It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets.\" \r\nMcMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. \r\n\r\nUnder The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb\r\nBy Christopher Edmonds <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>\r\nSpecial to TheStreet.com\r\n10/26/2001 05:08 PM EDT\r\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/comment/chrisedmonds/10003075.html>\r\n\r\nWhile the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. \r\nWhat's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, \"I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe.\" \r\nPeter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. \r\nThe rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. \r\nNow, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. \r\nThe Company's Challenge\r\nBut what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. \r\n\"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,\" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. \"We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.\" \r\nDietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. \r\nStraightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. \r\nAlthough Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. \r\nThe divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. \r\nThe credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. \r\nFrankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. \"If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Dietert says. \"In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow.\" \r\nIt's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. \r\nThere's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, \"Why? Ask why.\" \r\nInvestors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer. \r\nFirst Things First\r\nMany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week. Thank you for your concern. My father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade. \r\nThe choice was easy. I'm with him and my family. \r\nEnjoy your weekend with family and friends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default\r\n2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)\r\n\r\n   By Kristen McNamara \r\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \r\n \r\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its\r\ncredit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the\r\nevent was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the\r\norganization that developed the market's rules said Friday. \r\n\r\n  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy\r\nServices last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a\r\ngreater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at\r\nrisk for expulsion from New England's market. \r\n\r\n  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that\r\ntriggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the\r\npast, the market's rulemaker said. \r\n\r\n  \"I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other\r\nparticipants\" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, \"and it's never\r\nbeen in the news,\" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New\r\nEngland Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's\r\nelectricity market. \"My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of\r\nproportion.\" \r\n\r\n  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major\r\nmetropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed\r\nby its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's\r\nstock and bond prices. \r\n\r\n  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its\r\nbonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem\r\nwithin a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. \r\n\r\n  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,\r\nto notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong\r\nperson, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. \r\n\r\n  \"Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to\r\nensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,\" Mahoney said. \r\n\r\n  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England\r\nspokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its\r\ndefault. \r\n\r\n  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on\r\noccasion, Foley and Doot said. \r\n\r\n  \"I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant\r\nto find itself out of compliance,\" Doot said. \"Those things have in fact\r\nhappened from time to time.\" \r\n\r\n  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\r\n2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)\r\n\r\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\r\n\r\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit\r\nalleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services\r\ncould temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed\r\nInternet service in some U.S. regions.\r\n\r\n     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company\r\nfrom providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron\r\nprovides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in\r\nthe 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.\r\noperates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.\r\n\r\n     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to\r\noffer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to\r\ngive the largest software company access to potential customers in\r\n29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is\r\nmaking a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.\r\n\r\n     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly\r\nas possible and at the same time we are evaluating other\r\nproviders,'' Visse said.\r\n\r\n     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,\r\ndid not immediately return calls for comment.\r\n\r\n                         The Agreement\r\n\r\n     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide\r\nbandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron\r\nisn't required to deliver operational broadband services if\r\nMicrosoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow\r\nJones newswire reported.\r\n\r\n     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver\r\nthe ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of\r\nthe deal, Dow reported.\r\n\r\n     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23\r\nletter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't\r\nprovided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing\r\nMicrosoft to recover damages.\r\n\r\n     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents\r\nto $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.\r\n\r\n--Joyzelle Davis in Los Angeles (213) 617-0582, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits\r\n2001-10-26 15:36 (New York)\r\n\r\nEnron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits\r\n\r\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder\r\nsuing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy\r\ntrader to disclose any income they made from their involvement\r\nwith affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.\r\n\r\n     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,\r\nVice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff\r\nMcMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices\r\nthis week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm\r\nAbbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such\r\nas Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.\r\n\r\n     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who\r\nis suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial\r\nOfficer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at\r\nleast $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder\r\nequity.\r\n\r\n     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives\r\nbenefited financially from roles as officers and directors of\r\npartnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at\r\nleast 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and\r\nemployees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according\r\nto Texas secretary of state records.\r\n\r\n     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests\r\nwill result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next\r\nweek if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron\r\nspokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment\r\nabout the document requests.\r\n\r\n     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron\r\nspokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests\r\nin the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer\r\nsaid. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to\r\nthe boards of affiliates.\r\n\r\n                       Affiliates Have Debts\r\n\r\n     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,\r\nFrevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list\r\ntheir address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as\r\nofficers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign\r\nbusiness corporations.\r\n\r\n     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on\r\nany form of compensation or benefit received from any of the\r\naffiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the\r\nexecutives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the\r\naffiliates.\r\n\r\n     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets\r\nsuch as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron\r\nto move debt associated with those projects off its books.\r\n\r\n     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They\r\nplan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron\r\nmight be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and\r\nthe debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets\r\ndon't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n                            Few Answers\r\n\r\n     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer\r\nKenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a\r\nconference call Tuesday.\r\n\r\n     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to\r\nquestions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.\r\n\r\n     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as\r\nofficers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC.

Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers\r\nhave denied the charges repeatedly.\r\n\r\n     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the\r\npower market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and\r\nother generators are complying with subpoenas for trading\r\ndocuments. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I\r\ndon't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra\r\nMontgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be\r\nseen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.\r\n\r\n     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in\r\nCalifornia soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities\r\ninsolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market\r\nto competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison\r\nInternational weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.\r\n\r\n     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the\r\ncommittee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are\r\nputting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to\r\na speedy resolution.''\r\n\r\n     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half\r\nsince Oct. 16.

'' Lockyer\r\nlater apologized for the remark.\r\n\r\n     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer\r\nspokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know\r\nwhen civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power\r\nproviders might be filed.\r\n\r\n     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We\r\nhad to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that\r\nslowed things down a bit.''\r\n\r\n     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney\r\ngeneral's investigation.\r\n\r\n     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness\r\nto take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his\r\nvulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.\r\n\r\n                           More Lawsuits\r\n\r\n     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke\r\nEnergy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging\r\nthey manipulated California energy prices in violation of\r\nantitrust laws.\r\n\r\n     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the\r\nCity of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz\r\nBustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts\r\nawaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer\r\nrepresenting Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a\r\njudge by the end of next month, he said.\r\n\r\n     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to\r\nrepay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including\r\ntriple damages.\r\n\r\n     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,\r\ndeclining for the eighth day in a row.

The shares fell 95 cents,\r\nor 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.\r\n\r\n     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure\r\ninvestors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors\r\nsaid.

No,''\r\nsaid John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth\r\nThird Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of\r\nmanagement.''\r\n\r\n      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion\r\nin commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark\r\nPalmer said.\r\n\r\n                            Bonds Drop\r\n\r\n     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1\r\n1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86\r\ncents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''\r\nyield 9.53 percent.\r\n\r\n     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit\r\nrating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses\r\nfrom failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash\r\ndaily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to\r\nsettle transactions.\r\n\r\n     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart\r\nfinancial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's\r\nInvestors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the\r\nhassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and\r\ninsured access to capital.''\r\n\r\n     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their\r\nyield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds\r\nthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies\r\nwith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back\r\nholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value\r\nof Enron investors' stock.\r\n\r\n     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron\r\nassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to\r\nthe partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The\r\npartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n                         Other Liabilities\r\n\r\n     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money\r\ncomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find\r\nthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would\r\nhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell\r\nfor and the amount of the debt.\r\n\r\n     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron\r\npreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would\r\nthin out the holdings of every other investor.\r\n\r\n     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have\r\nEnron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's\r\nlowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones\r\nRating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''\r\none notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''\r\n\r\n     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount\r\nto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.\r\n\r\n     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on\r\nWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a\r\npartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct\r\nlosses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the\r\npartnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.\r\n\r\n     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for\r\nthe benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the\r\nbenefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.\r\n\r\n     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was\r\nnamed CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651, or at\r\n\r\n\r\nKeller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees\r\n\r\n10/26/2001\r\nBusiness Wire\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\r\n\r\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. \r\nThe investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.\r\nOn Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking \"non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,\" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. \r\nIf you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. \r\nSeattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT: Keller Rohrback L.L.P.

Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. \r\nThe extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. \r\nEnron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. \r\nTen Long Days\r\nEnron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. \r\nThe turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.\r\nEnron's End Run?   \r\nNew financial chief's involvement in Enron business partners\r\nEnron-Related Entity\tCreation DateMcMahon Involved?\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\nECT Strategic Value Corp.4/18/1985\tYes\t\t\r\nJILP-LP Inc.\t9/27/1995\tYes\t\r\nECT Investments Inc.\t3/1/1996\tYes\t\r\nKenobe Inc.\t11/8/1996\tYes\t\r\nEnserco LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\r\nObi-1 Holdings LLC\t1/7/1997\tYes\t\r\nOilfield Business Investments1/7/1997\tYes\t\t\r\nHGK Enterprises LP Inc.\t7/29/1997\tYes\t\r\nECT Eocene Enterprises III Inc.2/20/1998Yes\t\t\t\r\nJedi Capital II LLC\t9/4/1998\tYes\t\r\nE.C.T.

The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. \r\nAmong ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. \r\nDemands, Demands\r\nRating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. \r\nIf Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. \r\nFriday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. \r\nThis week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the \"market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets.\" He added: \"It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets.\" \r\nMcMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. \r\n\r\nUnder The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb\r\nBy Christopher Edmonds <mailto:cedmonds@thestreet.com>\r\nSpecial to TheStreet.com\r\n10/26/2001 05:08 PM EDT\r\nURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/comment/chrisedmonds/10003075.html>\r\n\r\nWhile the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. \r\nWhat's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, \"I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe.\" \r\nPeter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. \r\nThe rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. \r\nNow, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. \r\nThe Company's Challenge\r\nBut what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. \r\n\"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months,\" says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. \"We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.\" \r\nDietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. \r\nStraightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. \r\nAlthough Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. \r\nThe divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. \r\nThe credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. \r\nFrankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. \"If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Dietert says. \"In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow.\" \r\nIt's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. \r\nThere's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, \"Why? Ask why.\" \r\nInvestors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer. \r\nFirst Things First\r\nMany readers have asked about my relative quietness this week. Thank you for your concern. My father has fallen ill after fighting the effects of a brain tumor for more than a decade. \r\nThe choice was easy. I'm with him and my family. \r\nEnjoy your weekend with family and friends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default\r\n2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)\r\n\r\n   By Kristen McNamara \r\n   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES \r\n \r\n  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its\r\ncredit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the\r\nevent was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the\r\norganization that developed the market's rules said Friday. \r\n\r\n  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy\r\nServices last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a\r\ngreater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at\r\nrisk for expulsion from New England's market. \r\n\r\n  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that\r\ntriggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the\r\npast, the market's rulemaker said. \r\n\r\n  \"I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other\r\nparticipants\" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, \"and it's never\r\nbeen in the news,\" said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New\r\nEngland Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's\r\nelectricity market. \"My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of\r\nproportion.\" \r\n\r\n  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major\r\nmetropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed\r\nby its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's\r\nstock and bond prices. \r\n\r\n  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its\r\nbonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem\r\nwithin a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. \r\n\r\n  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,\r\nto notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong\r\nperson, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. \r\n\r\n  \"Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to\r\nensure that we would never exceed the volume limit,\" Mahoney said. \r\n\r\n  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England\r\nspokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its\r\ndefault. \r\n\r\n  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on\r\noccasion, Foley and Doot said. \r\n\r\n  \"I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant\r\nto find itself out of compliance,\" Doot said. \"Those things have in fact\r\nhappened from time to time.\" \r\n\r\n  -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\r\n2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)\r\n\r\nEnron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN\r\n\r\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit\r\nalleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services\r\ncould temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed\r\nInternet service in some U.S. regions.\r\n\r\n     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company\r\nfrom providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron\r\nprovides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in\r\nthe 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.\r\noperates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.\r\n\r\n     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to\r\noffer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to\r\ngive the largest software company access to potential customers in\r\n29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is\r\nmaking a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.\r\n\r\n     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly\r\nas possible and at the same time we are evaluating other\r\nproviders,'' Visse said.\r\n\r\n     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,\r\ndid not immediately return calls for comment.\r\n\r\n                         The Agreement\r\n\r\n     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide\r\nbandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron\r\nisn't required to deliver operational broadband services if\r\nMicrosoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow\r\nJones newswire reported.\r\n\r\n     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver\r\nthe ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of\r\nthe deal, Dow reported.\r\n\r\n     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23\r\nletter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't\r\nprovided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing\r\nMicrosoft to recover damages.\r\n\r\n     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents\r\nto $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.\r\n\r\n--Joyzelle Davis in Los Angeles (213) 617-0582, or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits\r\n2001-10-26 15:36 (New York)\r\n\r\nEnron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits\r\n\r\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder\r\nsuing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy\r\ntrader to disclose any income they made from their involvement\r\nwith affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.\r\n\r\n     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,\r\nVice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff\r\nMcMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices\r\nthis week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm\r\nAbbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such\r\nas Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.\r\n\r\n     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who\r\nis suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial\r\nOfficer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at\r\nleast $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder\r\nequity.\r\n\r\n     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives\r\nbenefited financially from roles as officers and directors of\r\npartnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at\r\nleast 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and\r\nemployees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according\r\nto Texas secretary of state records.\r\n\r\n     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests\r\nwill result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next\r\nweek if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron\r\nspokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment\r\nabout the document requests.\r\n\r\n     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron\r\nspokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests\r\nin the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer\r\nsaid. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to\r\nthe boards of affiliates.\r\n\r\n                       Affiliates Have Debts\r\n\r\n     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,\r\nFrevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list\r\ntheir address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as\r\nofficers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign\r\nbusiness corporations.\r\n\r\n     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on\r\nany form of compensation or benefit received from any of the\r\naffiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the\r\nexecutives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the\r\naffiliates.\r\n\r\n     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets\r\nsuch as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron\r\nto move debt associated with those projects off its books.\r\n\r\n     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money.

Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers\r\nhave denied the charges repeatedly.\r\n\r\n     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the\r\npower market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and\r\nother generators are complying with subpoenas for trading\r\ndocuments. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I\r\ndon't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra\r\nMontgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be\r\nseen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.\r\n\r\n     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in\r\nCalifornia soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities\r\ninsolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market\r\nto competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison\r\nInternational weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.\r\n\r\n     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the\r\ncommittee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are\r\nputting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to\r\na speedy resolution.''\r\n\r\n     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half\r\nsince Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief\r\nfinancial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange\r\nCommission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35\r\nmillion.\r\n\r\n                            Grand Jury\r\n\r\n     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for\r\ncivil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill\r\nLockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.\r\n\r\n     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling\r\nthe Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron\r\nChairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with\r\na tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer\r\nlater apologized for the remark.\r\n\r\n     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer\r\nspokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know\r\nwhen civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power\r\nproviders might be filed.\r\n\r\n     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We\r\nhad to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that\r\nslowed things down a bit.''\r\n\r\n     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney\r\ngeneral's investigation.\r\n\r\n     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness\r\nto take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his\r\nvulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.\r\n\r\n                           More Lawsuits\r\n\r\n     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke\r\nEnergy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging\r\nthey manipulated California energy prices in violation of\r\nantitrust laws.\r\n\r\n     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the\r\nCity of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz\r\nBustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts\r\nawaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer\r\nrepresenting Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a\r\njudge by the end of next month, he said.\r\n\r\n     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to\r\nrepay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including\r\ntriple damages.\r\n\r\n     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,\r\ndeclining for the eighth day in a row.

The shares fell 95 cents,\r\nor 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.\r\n\r\n     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure\r\ninvestors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors\r\nsaid. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,\r\nwhere short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.\r\n\r\n     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''\r\nsaid John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth\r\nThird Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of\r\nmanagement.''\r\n\r\n      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion\r\nin commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark\r\nPalmer said.\r\n\r\n                            Bonds Drop\r\n\r\n     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1\r\n1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86\r\ncents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''\r\nyield 9.53 percent.\r\n\r\n     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit\r\nrating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses\r\nfrom failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash\r\ndaily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to\r\nsettle transactions.\r\n\r\n     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart\r\nfinancial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's\r\nInvestors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the\r\nhassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and\r\ninsured access to capital.''\r\n\r\n     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their\r\nyield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds\r\nthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies\r\nwith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back\r\nholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value\r\nof Enron investors' stock.\r\n\r\n     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron\r\nassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to\r\nthe partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The\r\npartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n                         Other Liabilities\r\n\r\n     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money\r\ncomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find\r\nthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would\r\nhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell\r\nfor and the amount of the debt.\r\n\r\n     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron\r\npreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would\r\nthin out the holdings of every other investor.\r\n\r\n     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have\r\nEnron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's\r\nlowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones\r\nRating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''\r\none notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''\r\n\r\n     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount\r\nto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.\r\n\r\n     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on\r\nWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a\r\npartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct\r\nlosses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the\r\npartnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.\r\n\r\n     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for\r\nthe benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the\r\nbenefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.\r\n\r\n     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was\r\nnamed CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651, or at\r\n\r\n\r\nKeller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees\r\n\r\n10/26/2001\r\nBusiness Wire\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\r\n\r\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. \r\nThe investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.\r\nOn Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking \"non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share,\" in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. \r\nIf you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. \r\nSeattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade.

Emshwiller\r\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nA3\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nEnron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major energy-trading companies. \r\nInvestors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, with annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billion, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's traded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operation, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in transactions.\r\n\"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. \"There's not a trader out there that doesn't use EnronOnline.\" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid. \r\nEnron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar with the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions. \r\nWhile Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. \"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement. \r\nEnron said Mr. Fastow \"will be on a leave of absence from the company.\" He couldn't be reached for comment. \r\nIt remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at nearly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-active stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stock. \r\nEnron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier this year, the stock was above $80 a share. \r\nIn an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies, which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, Dynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles. \r\nPrudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could be seen as evidence that \"management does care\" about investor concerns. However, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming as it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as \"an admission of guilt.\" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron largely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financial structure. \r\nEnron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings. \r\nWorries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible \"death spiral\" in which increasing credit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any evidence of such a problem. \r\nHowever, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities. Enron is facing a problem with \"trust and credibility. It's not easy to regain something as basic as trust,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Looks at Dealings\r\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe New York Times\r\nPage 2, Column 5\r\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\r\n\r\nThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\n''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''\r\nThe company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer. \r\nEnron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night. \r\nThe move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it. \r\nOn Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions. \r\nThe fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand. \r\nBy structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address. \r\nConcerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either in cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate. \r\nMr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75. \r\nAccording to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said. \r\nShares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours trading, they fell to $16.14. \r\nOne of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell'' from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Monday. \r\n''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yesterday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.'' \r\nBut she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People could fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get any answers.''\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The company said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares. \r\nEnron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quarter earnings on Oct 16. \r\nThe earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enron's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment. \r\nThe partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron, served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments. \r\nBut Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time. \r\nSo Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also ended its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enron took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. \r\nTuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a \"Chinese wall\" existed between Enron and LJM. \r\nFastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer before moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up the company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortable with the Fastow-LJM setup. \r\nEnron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available for comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving a salary. \r\nEnron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \"informal inquiry\" into the LJM dealings. \r\nThe news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling in August for personal reasons. \r\nA continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followed the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry. \r\nWall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations. \r\nBeyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partnerships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities. \r\nInvestors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business. \r\nIn the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38. \r\nWednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, which closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets. \r\nA conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with analysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped. \r\nOn Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, moved from a \"hold\" to a \"sell\" rating. \r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief.\r\nBy JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY.\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\r\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price. \r\nEnron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.\r\nKenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off. \r\nThat loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the partnerships established with Mr Fastow. \r\nAnalysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earlier served as Enron's treasurer. \r\nAnalysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough. Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demonstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called for Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those calls. \r\nMs Coale issued a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. \"We are concerned about what we don't know,\" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure. \r\nEnron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong.

To lose the chief financial officer as well looks like carelessness.\r\nEnron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in its third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1.2bn equity charge related to the closing of \"related party transactions\" with two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention that the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest anyone? \r\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. Investors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so after its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposite effect. \r\nThe charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes receivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. The uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack of disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlikely to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for shareholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief executive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problem goes beyond one individual. \r\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. \r\nhttp://www.ft.com.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nHOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list investors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the company stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. \r\n\"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC,\" Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. \"Who knows?\"\r\nEnron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Monday's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by Fastow. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed Wednesday. \r\nFastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, who has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets group, takes over his role. \r\n\"I think change is good at this particular point in time,\" said FAC Equities analyst Robert Christensen said. \"I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered.\" \r\nA.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships. \r\n\"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,\" Heim said. \r\nReplacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added. \r\n\"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community,\" Heim said. \"Instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever.\" \r\nEnron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 per share, a 17 percent decline. \r\nSince the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week, Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent. \r\n\"The market was asking for that to happen,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said of Fastow's departure. \"This is really the first time Enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis.\" \r\nPreviously, Enron's managers have been \"cautious and defensive in their approach,\" he said. \r\nDuring a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have since been dissolved. \r\nThe call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim. \r\n\"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever expect to take any more charges,\" Heim said. \"What I heard is we don't have to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed.\" \r\nThe turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third quarter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's future, Heim said. \r\n\"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now, two years from now,\" he said. \r\nBut much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, Feygin said. \r\nFeygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer. \r\n\"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the partnerships),\" Feygin said. \"Three days ago I would have said there is no need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was something Enron needed to do.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nFacing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble. \r\nAfter failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conference call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasurer Jeff McMahon.\r\nThe move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. The stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion of shareholder wealth. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said. \r\nEarly last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, resulting from US$1.01-billion in write-offs. \r\nThe company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow. \r\nIn July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently looking into the partnership arrangement. \r\nThe turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors. \r\nDuring the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships. \r\nThe stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this week, to \"sell\" from \"hold.\" Ms. Coale said the rating change is \"not because of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't know about the company.\" \r\nVolume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average daily volume is 6.7 million shares. \r\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's line during the conference call. \r\nThe company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder equity. But Mr. Feygin said management was \"defensive\" when pressed for details. \r\nMs. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad news was to come. \r\nWhile the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the company's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term fortunes. \r\nLast week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's lowered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Third-quarter charges of $1.01 billion from failed investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped out 70% of the profit earned in the last four quarters. \r\n\"Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to Andy,\" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded Enron to \"long-term buy\" and owns no shares. \r\nFastow, 39, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million in third-quarter losses. \r\nEnron also bought back 62 million shares from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment. \r\nDuring a conference call Tuesday, Lay said, \"I and Enron's board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as CFO.\" \r\nEnron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock closed down $3.38, or 17%, to $16.41 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, setting a new 52-week low. \r\nThe SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday. Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received. \r\nThe company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office indicate.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As details of this deal, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54% in just seven days. \r\nWednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group. \r\nHow might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to show that the \"Fastow era\" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2. \r\nClearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct. \r\nNot much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company? \r\nThe spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence. \r\nEnron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board. \r\nIn fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed the LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders. \r\nLay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency. \r\nAny efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management? \r\n\r\n\r\nPhew!

Did it create a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoarding it, perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled? Did we wipe out billions in equity of utilities in some sort of bizarre zero-sum game in which Enron won it all and shareholders from California utilities lost? \r\nAnd was Enron at the hub of a vast power conspiracy to screw the U.S. consumer? \r\nSomehow, I believe that if it weren't for the events of Sept. 11 and its aftermath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department antitrust division or a Congressional investigation. To me, this one smells worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time. \r\nAnd we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to the bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history. \r\nWe ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treble damages that violators owe. \r\nWhat surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want to make his name blowing this one wide open. \r\nThis nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abandon the white-collar folks, either. \r\nThere was just too much money lost too fast for what, in an era where energy seems pretty plentiful, couldn't possibly, in retrospect, be considered a real shortage. \r\nRandom musings: See you on CNBC'S \"Squawk,\" where I will, if given the chance, talk about Viacom (VIA^B:NYSE - news - commentary) , ChevronTexaco (CVX:NYSE - news - commentary) , United Technologies (UTX:NYSE - news - commentary) and Wells Fargo (WFC:NYSE - news - commentary) , all of which have some nice cyclicality to them, which is what is called for at this very moment. \r\n\r\n\r\nSmall-Stock Focus: Russell 2000 Ekes Out Increase; Adtran, Arris Group Post Gains\r\nBy Karen Talley\r\nDow Jones Newswires\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nC6\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK -- It was a day for small-cap stocks to hug the baseline -- barely moving -- before ending the day with a slight gain as a number of positive profit reports pitched them onto positive ground. \r\nThe Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks rose 0.28 point, or 0.07%, to 427.65, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 27.10, or 1.59%, to 1731.54.\r\nGiven small caps' modest advance, their finishing the day higher hardly was guaranteed. For a while, in fact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues and blue chips, although there were moments when these stocks, too, slipped into negative territory. \r\nThe day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and investors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not. \r\nGenerally for small caps, \"It's `where do we go from here' time,\" said Andrew Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot of small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market reopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons to be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. \"Now, it seems the whole market is looking for direction.\" \r\nOn the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, with 1.321 billion advancing and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced decliners by 1,902 to 1,628. \r\nIt was tech all the way among the day's top performers. \r\nCommunications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and networking firms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.2%, to 23.97, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Networks added 93 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17. \r\nSemiconductors were the session's second-best presenters with, among small caps, Elantec Semiconductor adding 3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.80. \r\nWireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-cap Nextel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after posting a third-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued firmness in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps, AirGate PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78. \r\nThe day's poorest performers were natural-gas utilities, which continued to be dragged down by large cap Enron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedmont Natural Gas fell 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 30.63, and Peoples Energy shed 56 cents, or 1.4%, to 39.06. \r\nPegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Cambridge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even stronger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estimate by 10 cents a share. \r\nPinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. The Mountain View, Calif., video-production-system maker had a fiscal first-quarter loss of 11 cents a share before items, beating Wall Street expectations by eight cents a share. Thomas Weisel upgraded shares to `buy' from `market perform.' \r\nSybase jumped 1.99, or 17%, to 13.50. The Emeryville, Calif., online-software developer reported 20 cents a share in earnings before items, beating Wall Street's expectations by two cents a share. \r\nIn a follow-on offering, AmeriPath gained 2.24, or 8.4%, to 29.04 after offering 4.125 million shares at $26 each. The follow-on, as is the custom, was priced at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80. \r\nMerger activity had a positive effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3.38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Billerica, Mass., semiconductor-equipment maker signed a definitive agreement to be bought by Brooks Automation for about $380 million in stock. Under the accord, which was approved by both companies' boards, PRI shareholders will receive 0.52 Brooks share for each PRI share held. Brooks Automation fell 1.31, 3.9%, to 31.80. \r\nVysis surged 7.26, or 31%, to 30.26. The Downers Grove, Ill., genetic-disease researcher agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $30.50 a share, or $355 million. Abbott rose 38 cents to 54.24. \r\nONI Systems dropped 1.01, or 15%, to 5.62. The San Jose, Calif., maker of fiber-optic communication equipment met analysts' third-quarter consensus estimate of 19 cents a share, excluding items, but said its fourth-quarter loss will range between 16 cents and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $40 million to $50 million, when analysts were expecting a loss of 16 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $50.1 million.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's co-founder said yesterday. \r\nIn a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.\r\n\"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Ms. Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. \r\nPlanned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. \r\nOnly directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. \r\nMs. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. \r\nTheir latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. \r\n\"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. \r\nThe corporate governance movement, since its beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. \r\nOne example would be Enron Corp., whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow said. \r\n\"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here.\" \r\nTaking the corporate governance argument a step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. \r\n\"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said. \r\nInstitutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. \r\n\"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,\" said Peter Gleason, vice-president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. \r\nSurveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. \"More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,\" Mr. Gleason said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The move follows Tuesday's conference call, which was an attempt by Enron to restore investor confidence in the company.\r\n\"Andy Fastow was a very well-regarded, low profile individual at Enron, and he's been unfairly pilloried in the press,\" said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. \"But the weight of circumstantial evidence and the material stock price decline made this inevitable.\"\r\nOlson predicted the CFO swap would improve Enron's credibility with Wall Street.\r\nA rough week\r\nEnron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved. \r\nEnron said Fastow had taken a leave of absence and that McMahon, most recently chairman and CEO of the industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000, would take over.\r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Lay, in a statement.\r\nKaren Denne, a spokesperson for Enron, said numerous discussions Tuesday and Wednesday led to the decision. She said she did not know when Fastow would return. \r\nShares of Enron fell more than 17 percent Wednesday to $16.41, then fell further in late trading following the announcement, to as low as $16.18. At one point during the trading day, the shares were trading at a six-year low of $15.51. \r\nAnalysts deliver blows\r\nOlson called Tuesday's conference call a \"missed opportunity,\" saying Enron had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had become more \"forthright and open.\"\r\n\"Unfortunately Enron is overloaded with lawyers,\" said Olson, who has not recommended the stock until recently. \"This company has been very much abused and maligned by people on Wall Street. They have some excellent businesses, and they have been carrying some losers.\" Enron has \"an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses, and excellent surplus cash flow,\" Olson said.\r\nEnron expects to generate $3 billion of cash flow this year, and with $500 million devoted to dividends and $1 billion to maintenance capital spending, the company will have $1.5 billion free.\r\nSeveral Wall Street firms cut their ratings on Enron shares Wednesday, including Prudential Securities. The firm advised clients to sell the stock, a rare recommendation. Prudential had rated the company's shares a \"hold.\" \r\n\"After much consideration, we are lowering our rating ... not because of things we know but because of things we potentially don't know about the company,\" wrote Prudential analyst Carol Coale in a note. \r\nOn Monday, Enron announced that related-party transactions within the limited partnerships are under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Several shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed.\r\n\"Management used the SEC inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the issue at hand, the LJM transactions,\" Coale said in reference to the conference call. \r\nOlson said it's unlikely that Enron, with its coterie of lawyers, would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles, but as to whether it was \"right,\" he conceded it was probably not.\r\nJ.P. Morgan's Anatol Feygin downgraded his rating to \"long-term buy\" from \"buy,\" saying an upgrade is precluded until the company provides more information about its liabilities. \r\n\"Management's conference call yesterday was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns,\" Feygin wrote. \r\nMerrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey noted Wednesday that if Enron isn't able to maintain its investment-grade ratings -- the company's debt is on watch for a potential downgrade by Moody's Investors Service -- issuing new equity would be one course of action, though with the potential to reduce earnings-per-share. Enron on Tuesday held with its forecast of $1.80 a share for 2001. \r\n\"New equity would potentially dilute our EPS estimates 5 to 10 percent,\" Eassey wrote in a follow-up to the conference call. \r\nBut Eassey believes that cash flow from operations -- expected to exceed $3 billion in 2002 -- along with asset sales, should be enough to \"insulate\" the company's credit ratings.\r\nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA: UPDATE 1-Beleaguered Enron names new CFO.\r\nBy Jeff Franks\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nReuters English News Service\r\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\r\n\r\nHOUSTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , trying to halt a freefall in its stock price and a firestorm of criticism from Wall Street, named a new chief financial officer on Wednesday to replace Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators. \r\nThe company, which is the nation's largest energy trader, said Fastow would take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jeff McMahon, who has been running an Enron unit and is the company's former treasurer, in a bid to restore credibility with investors.\r\nFastow's departure follows the August resignation of chief executive Jeff Skilling, who said he wanted a change in lifestyle after just six months on the job. \r\nWednesday's change came after Enron's stock fell $3.38 to $16.41, its lowest point in six years, to cap off a $13 billion plunge in market value since the company announced a third quarter loss last week and wrote down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in a move related to the questionable transactions. \r\nWall Street's anxieties about Enron spread to the stocks of other natural gas and power traders and marketers on Wednesday, with Dynegy Inc. falling 12.8 percent to $37.26 and Aquila Inc. off 11.7 percent at $21.20. \r\nInvestors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. \r\nWall Street analysts who once touted the company have bitterly accused it of not being forthcoming about the matter, a problem Enron chief executive Ken Lay cited in his appointment of McMahon. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" he said in a statement. \r\nMcMahon, who was treasurer from 1998 to 2000 before becoming chief executive officer of Enron's Industrial Markets group, has a \"deep and thorough understanding of Enron\" and the confidence of the investment world, Lay said. \r\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that it was McMahon who first spoke up about the perception of impropriety in the limited partnership arrangements made by Fastow. The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. \r\nFastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues because of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against the company. \r\nAs recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a corporate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money machine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodities. \r\nBut some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an Indian power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation. \r\nThere also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements had become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. \r\nAnalysts said the replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but not a panacea for its credibility problems. \r\n\"The problems investors are having with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnership arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those concerns,\" said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. \r\n\"I don't think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these partnerships,\" he said. \"I still have a lot of questions.\" \r\nAndre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not that helpful. \r\n\"Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that clears up the picture,\" he said. \"Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have clean hands when it comes to these transactions.\" \r\n\"The fear driving the market is: if this is what we know, how much worse can it get?\" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Closest was Dynegy Inc. which closed with a loss of $5.45, or 12.76 percent, at $37.26 - its lowest price in three weeks. \r\nPOWER EARNINGS FORECASTS TRIMMED \r\nThe talk of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and trading came from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - American Electric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. and PPL Corp. . \r\nEarly Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, change in earnings per share next year from this year, citing expectations of lower profits on power sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The company also confirmed it still sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share. \r\nNoting PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia Securities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to \"market perform\" from \"strong buy\" explaining PPL's \"failure to differentiate itself from the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility. \r\n\"The company will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to be afforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks,\" he concluded. \r\nDeutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar downgrades in Exelon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectations. \r\nSTOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES \r\n\"The primary driver (for the 2002 estimate) is lower wholesale commodity price assumptions at (the company's generation unit), in addition to weaker distribution demand\" at Exelon's utility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chicago, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday. \r\nExelon officials noted, in answer to analyst questions, that the view of 2002 demand had changed to negative from flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. \r\nThe company's stock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the earnings release early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares continued to advance Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers among the 40 S&P Utility Index components. \r\nThe big loser among the integrated utilities - those which produce and distribute power - was PPL, which ended the day at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 percent. \r\nLosses of about 1.3 percent were posted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, which slipped 52 cents to $39.48. \r\nAEP \"management cautioned that the slowing economy may make the upper end (of its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to $3.90) more difficult to achieve,\" Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrote in a note that maintained his estimate. \r\nHe lowered his estimate of PSEG 2002 earnings per share 5 cents to $4.05 while awaiting the closing of a Peruvian purchase and pointed out it receives more for electricity than most PJM power producers because of restraints on the delivery of Midwest electricity to New Jersey's power hungry markets.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(\"Enron\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: ENE) and its principal officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through and including October 18, 2001, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). \r\nThe complaint alleges that Enron and its principal officers and directors violated Section 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of l934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaint alleges that defendants misled investors (1) by reporting assets that were overvalued by more than $1 billion, which caused writedowns in that amount and are expected to lead to further writeoffs of hundreds of millions of dollars, (2) by concealing facts regarding relationships with a related entity that led to a more than $1 billion reduction of shareholders' equity and a $35 million charge, and (3) by obfuscating or failing to disclose the fact that agreements with other related entities satisfaction of which include obligations that may require the Company to issue large amounts of its shares. This misconduct caused the market prices of Enron stock to be artificially inflated during the Class Period. When facts about these matters were disclosed at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Company's per share stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the Company's stock despite the precurietous fall in its market price. Also, Enron's senior debt was placed on notice by Moody's for possible downgrade.\r\nAlso, an SEC inquiry into the Company's transactions with related entities has been announced, and the Company revealed that its Chief Financial Officer, who is one of the Defendants, has taken a \"leave of absence\" from the Company, and has been replaced. \r\nIf you purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through October 18, 2001, inclusive, you may, no later than December 21, 2001 move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff.

Enron\r\nagreed to renegotiate the terms of the transaction to let LJM2 buy\r\nthe shares two months early.\r\n\r\n    That let the partnership earn a $10.5 million in profit, the\r\nsuit says. If the transaction had not been renegotiated, the\r\npartnership would have lost $8 for every share it sold in\r\nSeptember, the suit alleges.\r\n\r\n                           `Bailed Out'\r\n\r\n     ``Mr. Fastow and LJM2 took advantage of inside information to\r\nreap illicit insider trading profits, in the millions of dollars\r\nin this transaction alone,'' the suit says.\r\n\r\n     At the same time that the LJM2 transaction was being\r\nrenegotiated in December and January, Chief Executive Officer\r\nKenneth Lay, President Mark Frevert and other top managers sold\r\nthe $73 million in shares, the suit alleges.\r\n\r\n     Enron executives ``bailed out of shares... reaping huge\r\ninsider trading profits,'' the lawsuit says.\r\n\r\n     Other sellers included former CEO Jeff Skilling, Chief\r\nStrategy Officer Cliff Baxter, broadband services CEO Ken Rice,\r\nChief of Staff Steve Kean, pipeline group CEO Stanley Horton and\r\nChief Risk Officer Richard Buy, the suit says.\r\n\r\n     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the\r\nlawsuit.\r\n\r\n     ``We haven't been served (notice of the suit), and it's our\r\npolicy not to talk about pending litigation,'' she said\r\n\r\n     In March, spokesman Mark Palmer said the executives exercised\r\nstock options that would have expired worthless otherwise.\r\n\r\n     Enron has formed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and\r\nsell company assets, according to records from the Texas secretary\r\nof state. The Houston-based company reported $1.01 billion in\r\nthird-quarter losses, including $35 million from the LJM\r\npartnerships run by Fastow.\r\n\r\n                            SEC Inquiry\r\n\r\n     Greenberg says directors shouldn't have allowed Fastow to run\r\npartnerships that bought and sold company assets.\r\n\r\n     Shares of Enron have fallen 52 percent in the past six days\r\non investor concern about the liabilities attached to partnerships\r\nand affiliated companies formed by Enron to remove debt from its\r\nbooks.

Third-quarter losses of $1.01 billion from failed\r\ninvestments outside the main commodities trading business wiped\r\nout 70 percent of the profit earned in the past four quarters.\r\n\r\n     ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to\r\nAndy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded\r\nEnron to ``long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.\r\n\r\n     As Enron treasurer, McMahon complained to then-Enron\r\nPresident Jeffrey Skilling about potential conflicts of interest\r\nposed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street Journal\r\nreported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the\r\nJournal said, citing people familiar with the matter.\r\n\r\n     ``McMahon was made famous under Skilling by going to him and\r\nobjecting to the partnerships,'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was\r\ntransferred out of the treasurer function into Enron Net Works,''\r\nwhich oversees Enron's Internet trading system.\r\n\r\n                       `An Outstanding Job'\r\n\r\n     Fastow, 39 years old, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,\r\ntwo partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's\r\ninvolvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million\r\nin third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares\r\nfrom LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.\r\n\r\n     On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's\r\nboard of directors continue to have the highest faith and\r\nconfidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as\r\nCFO.''\r\n\r\n      Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock\r\nclosed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in today's trading.\r\n\r\n      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday.\r\nSpokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron\r\nis cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.\r\n\r\n     The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships\r\nand corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as\r\npower plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\n     The Texas records list dozens of Enron executives as officers\r\nand directors of company-related partnerships. None of them have\r\nany financial interest in the partnerships after Fastow severed\r\nties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.\r\n\r\n                        `Zero Compensation'\r\n\r\n     ``The managers in these affiliates listed as managing members\r\nare representational in nature only,'' he said. ``They get zero\r\ncompensation.''\r\n\r\n     The LJM partnerships were different. Enron's board allowed\r\nFastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years, to run them\r\nand earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested,\r\nthe Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a\r\nshareholder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships\r\nreworked an agreement with Enron to avoid taking big losses.\r\n\r\n     Enron is obligated to repay $3.3 billion associated with two\r\nother partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, if they can't raise\r\nenough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, Enron\r\nspokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when\r\nasked if the partnerships will generate enough cash.\r\n\r\n     ``The concern now isn't just with the LJM partnership, it's\r\nmore with the other partnerships, such as Osprey and Marlin,''\r\nsaid A.G.

The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reserves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.\r\nAn Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit line, but said he couldn't supply any further details. \r\nHouston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favorite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convincing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, its finances remain sound. \r\nConfidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier this month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 billion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. \r\nLast week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consistently said that the transactions were proper and legal. \r\nEnron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. Enron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a Sept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63. \r\nLate last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that money being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Standard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was \"getting a bit more resistance\" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enron probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstanding, he said. \r\nThe Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on hand would give it more financial flexibility. \r\nAlso last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lower rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses. \r\nBehind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor confidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last week could impair \"Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business.\" \r\nThe Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are doing business with Enron on \"essentially the same terms\" as they have in the past. \"There has been no significant change in the credit conditions,\" he said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's finances. \r\nThe banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the new credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said. \r\nBankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. \"Confidence in this company was lost,\" said one bank official involved in the negotiations for a new credit line. \"But confidence will be restored.\" \r\nCorporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demonstrate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have access to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines. Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illustrates the pressure Enron is feeling.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas\r\nBy Paul Kedrosky\r\n\r\n10/29/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nA22\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nIs troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy markets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too many of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those are the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial releases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern. \r\nA year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.\r\nNot bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No longer. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenues, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and selling stakes in energy producers. \r\nThe stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at around 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke Energy. \r\nBut Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a \"new economy\" Web-based energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. According to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be valued accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the company's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its price then. \r\nThen the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under strange circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in California's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial statements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's troubles were hiding in plain sight. \r\nIt should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure there was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad. \r\nNot that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low return on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came from asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter. \r\nEnron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the company filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a \"senior officer of Enron is the managing member\" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron \"manage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar assets by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars.\" It was, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund. \r\nThere is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managing and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he severed his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this year -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had been done. \r\nAs stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnership allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enron relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-footed hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission were left with many questions, and very few answers. \r\nTo be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a year ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the company. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003. \r\nWe didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current round of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be seen, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and heroic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial transparency. \r\nWhere has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and retired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves. \r\n--- \r\nMr. Kedrosky is a professor of business at the University of British Colombia.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OPPEL Jr.\r\n\r\n10/29/2001\r\nThe New York Times\r\nPage 9, Column 4\r\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\r\n\r\nDALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure investors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions involving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billion in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today. \r\nLast week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off commercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a cash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or do business with it.\r\nEnron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last two weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any actions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said. \r\nTwo weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an inquiry into its financial accounting. \r\nEnron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucial to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. Lately, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and two major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the company's rating.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or 5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last week on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships created by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several leading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January. \r\nMost fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company in which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are \"dated\", implying that the funds' positions in the company have changed. \r\nMorningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said managers of the group's larger funds had been \"lightening up\" their Enron holdings this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagship Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say when. \r\nKen Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also declined to discuss his holdings, listed as 0.27 per cent of outstanding shares as of March 31. But Aim said the position had since been \"trimmed substantially\". \r\nOther top fund owners, as of the most recent filings, included the Alliance Premier Growth fund, the Janus Twenty, Janus Mercury and Janus Growth & Income funds, Fidelity Magellan, AXP New Dimensions Fund, Putnam Investors, Putnam Voyager and Putnam New Opportunities funds and Morgan Stanley Dividend Growth fund. \r\nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.\r\nBy SIMON LONDON and SHEILA MCNULTY.\r\n\r\n10/29/2001\r\nFinancial Times\r\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\nCOMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, the US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-wheeling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty. \r\nEnron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-based company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school professors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.\r\nIts share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar deals with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial officer, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions as it answered about these \"related-party transactions\". The departure of Andy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed. \r\nWith its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity. \r\n\"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side,\" observes Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank. \r\nOn the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of deteriorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial culture and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle \"new economy\" magic on to old economy companies. \r\nEnron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to develop energy trading. \r\nFor the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulating US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy under-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling who spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supplying it. \r\nThe two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackaging of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets. \r\nThe energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. Employees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they delivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: \"It was all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules.\" \r\nThe seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a \"loose-tight\" management model expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and McKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy business were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in existing markets. \r\nUp-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative force behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed jobs or was promoted seven times in five years. \r\nBalancing these loose management practices were tight central control of risk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr Skilling once described the approach in this way: \"As long as you clear your deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you want around here.\" \r\nThis approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather derivatives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable climatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. The success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world's leading e-commerce company. \r\nIt has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint venture with International Business Machines and America Online, the internet service provider. \r\nIn February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most powerful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of America and Boeing. \r\nIn retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was achieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-health related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explanation. \r\nA second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust and Azurix. \"They went after too many things too quickly,\" says Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency. \r\nA third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparency. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financial instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have little idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks to which it is exposed. \r\nDavid Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many investors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management: \"The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a need for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding something or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be questionable.\" \r\nThe fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. \"The problems, in our view, stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core skills,\" argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. \"Power plants in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the internet are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant energy business.\" \r\nEnron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for some of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enron Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This helped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when trading volumes failed to materialise. \r\n\"They over-promised on the new business they created,\" says Chris Bartlett, a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the company. \"Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the broadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price.\" \r\nWill Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-the-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant energy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith Barney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent of earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the past three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for disposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets. \r\nAnd yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight management methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team will have to tighten up. \r\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. \r\nhttp://www.ft.com.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\nEnron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade banks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fall in its share price. \r\nThe Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board meeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial disclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.\r\nLast week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its financial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good financial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong. \r\nMark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have something to announce in coming days from its latest effort to \"establish additional lines of liquidity\". \"Once we are able to get the liquidity position shored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest,\" Mr Palmer said. \r\nThe company's problems have become public since an announcement on October 16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders' equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, who was forced to take a leave of absence last week. \r\nEnron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 announcement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically \"junk\" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade. \r\n\"Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their ability to operate their trading and marketing operations,\" said Raymond Niles of Salomon Smith Barney. \"These activities require at least an investment grade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requirements.\" \r\nThe controversy over Enron's balance sheet adjustment has resulted in a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the\r\npartnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA: REPEAT-Electric cowboys get roped in at the energy corral.\r\nBy Janet McGurty\r\n\r\n10/29/2001\r\nReuters English News Service\r\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of investors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural gas now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its business dealings. \r\nEnron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its credit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial transactions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the past week.\r\nBut the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States is not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the market volatility that drove earnings last year eases. \r\nWhile Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other power producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for splitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy. \r\nPaul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common themes affecting the industry. \r\n\"One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. And two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven growth,\" Patterson said. \r\nAs earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some power companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. And plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off. \r\nShares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. \r\nTHE WORLD HAS CHANGED \r\nAES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consecutive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off assets. \r\n\"It's a different place,\" AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powerful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Baltimore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trading operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which planned to make an equity investment in the company. \r\n\"The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. economy, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we will be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver,\" said Christian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman. \r\nRETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES \r\nBakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed emphasis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business. \r\nIt makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 80 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth, according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise. \r\n\"Calpine does it already,\" he said, referring to the California-based independent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates contracted out. \"What drove the valuations in all these companies last year was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case - there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywhere near that level,\" he added. \r\nHowald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices should remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark spreads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies. \r\nSMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES \r\nAs lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning back to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line. \r\n\"Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 2002 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward revision of earnings guidance.\" said Patterson. \r\nMichigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second time to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off certain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America. \r\nCMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distribution units as well as other international investments. \r\nAllegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in third quarter earnings. \r\nThe Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards getting necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold its unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time. \r\n\"The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstrated value can and will be created for shareholders,\" Allegheny said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nThe Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly negotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it drew down billions on its existing lines. \r\nJ.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies with the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, with an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding \"in addition to derivatives and other structured product exposures,\" according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.\r\nMorgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loan facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 million loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also participated, Securities Data said. \r\nOn Thursday, Enron issued a statement that \"in order to dispel uncertainty in the financial community,\" it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line. \r\n\"We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity -- that's nothing out of the ordinary,\" said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. \r\nThe developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the departure of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. \r\nEnron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and services, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines. \r\n\"Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested along with Enron in some of its partnerships,\" said Ms. Applebaum. A spokesman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did not know the amount of its exposure. \r\nMany other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 million of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $100 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also have some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said. \r\nRepresentatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships with Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.americanbanker.com \r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers. \r\nIn its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reducing domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus. \r\nThe two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's existing power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron. \r\nEnron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan. \r\nThe Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility study by June 2002. \r\nTeijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OPPEL Jr.\r\n\r\n10/28/2001\r\nThe New York Times\r\nPage 1, Column 2\r\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\r\n\r\nIS time running out for Enron? \r\nAt the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to persuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from California to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its views would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.\r\nAnd under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron's arrogance had grown even more quickly. \r\nThe company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and consumer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for electricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the company profited from creating new markets. \r\n''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing those who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''People want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It's the American way.'' \r\nBut less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron's investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances are mounting. \r\nSome experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupted and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enron could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998. Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 billion in shareholder value. \r\nEnron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week low of $15.04 earlier in the day. \r\nThe future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ended only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by intervening deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making water supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capacity have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenneth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, to resume day-to-day control of the company. \r\nThe company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, available for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilling could not be reached. \r\nEnron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 billion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in Enron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors question whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of trading electricity and natural gas. \r\nTHE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controversy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seemed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today faces a potential cash crunch. \r\nThe surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concern about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex transactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cash. \r\nEnron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previously arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, which have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's importance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide. \r\nThe supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected even if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a producer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatility of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year. \r\nPhilip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he thought Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what would happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's EnronOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations. \r\n''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are they good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger said. ''It's got everyone scared.'' \r\nIn the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guaranteed. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less valuable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of the company. \r\nA drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy traders and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the company's sales and profits. \r\nEnron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bonds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possible downgrades. \r\n''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in Kansas City, Mo. \r\nFor now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Reliant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do business with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electricity and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling reminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. \r\n''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they are closing their books down,'' he said. \r\nStill, some executives at other companies said they were looking more carefully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly to discuss the situation. \r\nMark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading company had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any of the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business. \r\nBut the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is just a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, the details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who own its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creating lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impenetrability of its financial statements. \r\nNow they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers to the questions investors ask. \r\nTo others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statements parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect Enron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the giant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances. \r\nThe most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron created to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bonds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water company subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed the value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the difference. \r\nDEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial officer when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in shareholders' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only skimpy details of its transactions with those partnerships. \r\nEnron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a promissory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transaction was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report. \r\nThe transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statements into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The earnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, and its shares rose. \r\nIn a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The reference was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those analysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to slide, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved investors. \r\nMr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts about Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron who appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling and Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company. \r\nIn an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details about the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.'' \r\nMr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a grasp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking about them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot we can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the company expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by the end of next year. \r\nIn a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enron executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its other partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the deal, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming. \r\nDavid Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the company, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to clarify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming that would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company will likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note after the call. \r\nTo try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, its Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day, a higher-than-normal volume. \r\n''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay said in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strength is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.'' \r\nBut those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enron's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six years. \r\nNow analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new shares to make good on its partnership guarantees. \r\nCarol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates that Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said that Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about those prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring economy. \r\n''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.'' \r\n''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said. \r\nShort-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say. \r\n''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable.'' \r\nJames Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits. \r\nEven traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy. \r\n''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist. \r\nIN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \r\nEnron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices. \r\nLarge-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. Enron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one-quarter of all trading in the United States. \r\nBefore Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale electricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power business was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ever-growing portion of the nation's power. \r\nBeginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was also deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline company, to move into the trading business. \r\nThe company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in February, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its principal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, it had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum products.'' \r\nFor most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involvement. \r\nEnron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have to be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have to pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its investment-grade credit rating before that. \r\nENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could suffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's credit. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals sold the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy markets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that positions that should offset each other do not. \r\nEnron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share price, could rebound. \r\nBut for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take advantage of Enron's plight.\r\n\r\nPhotos: Enron, which is building a new headquarters in Houston, grew with deregulation.

Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers. \r\nQ. Why did Enron enter into the deals?\r\nA. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies. \r\nQ. How did those investments do? \r\nA. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that. \r\nQ. Why can't that be discerned? \r\nA. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely. \r\nQ. Why were they so complicated? \r\nA. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule. \r\nQ. Who made money from these transactions? \r\nA. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors. \r\nQ. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now? \r\nA. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important. \r\nQ. When were concerns raised with Enron? \r\nA. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By this summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partnerships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered related to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out its deals with the partnerships. \r\nQ. How did Enron do? \r\nA. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transactions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it also reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. \r\nQ. How did that happen? \r\nA. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnership owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enron. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a share buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and determined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce reported earnings. \r\nQ. Is that legal under the accounting rules? \r\nA. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on them. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lockheed Martin Corp. won the coveted right to build the nation's next-generation fighter aircraft, beating out Boeing Co. for what could be the biggest military contract ever. \r\nCulminating a five-year battle between two of the world's largest defense contractors, Pentagon officials picked Lockheed Martin to begin development of the Joint Strike Fighter, with plans to purchase 3,000 of the planes at a cost of more than $200 billion.\r\nWith the potential for foreign sales topping another $200 billion, the contract is considered the most lucrative in U.S. history. \"This really is the contract of the millennium,\" said Christopher Hellman, analyst with the Center for Defense Information. \"Nothing has or will come close. \" \r\nPeter Pae \r\nFord Settles Lawsuit Over Faulty Part \r\nIn the largest automotive class-action settlement in history, Ford Motor Co. will reimburse customers who paid hundreds of millions of dollars to replace a faulty part that caused their vehicles to stall. \r\nIt was uncertain how many consumers would qualify for reimbursements in the range of $160 apiece. \r\nThe settlement caps six years of litigation.

Peltz \r\nITC Says Imports Hurt Steel Industry \r\nThe International Trade Commission ruled that foreign imports pose a serious threat to the domestic steel industry, paving the way for punitive sanctions that are likely to raise steel prices and intensify trade tensions with Europe and Asia. \r\nThe independent U.S. agency has until mid-December to provide the White House with a list of proposed remedies, which could include import quotas or hefty tariffs on foreign steel. \r\nBeleaguered U.S. steelmakers applauded the decision. \r\nPresident Bush, who instigated the ITC investigation, is expected to approve the protective measures, though critics warn they could harm a weakened domestic economy and complicate efforts to launch a new round of global trade talks. \r\nEvelyn Iritani \r\nShares of Enron Plummet Amid Losses \r\nEnron Corp.'s stock was pummeled by investors following disclosures of losses and shrinking shareholders' equity related to failed investments and a complicated hierarchy of limited partnerships used to shelter some Enron assets. \r\nThe stock slide was compounded by disclosure of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into two of the partnership arrangements and by Wall Street worries about future cash flow and credit problems that might be caused by the investment vehicles. \r\nTwo conference calls with analysts and investors failed to calm nerves, and several analysts lowered their recommendations on Enron. \r\nEnron has reiterated that its finances are strong. And although analysts note that Enron's core businesses remain sound, some analysts doubt that the usually taciturn company has revealed all of its problems. \r\nTo mollify investors, Enron replaced its chief financial officer, who until recently headed the two partnerships the SEC is eyeing. \r\nNancy Rivera Brooks \r\nPentagon OKs Northrop Bid for Newport News \r\nNorthrop Grumman Corp. was all but assured of winning the bid to acquire Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. as the Pentagon endorsed the deal and the Justice Department, citing antitrust concerns, blocked a rival bid by General Dynamics Corp. \r\nIt marked a stunning turn of events for Northrop, which got the nod to acquire the Virginia builder of nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers despite having been the underdog. \r\nThe Los Angeles-based defense contractor made an unsolicited offer for Newport News after the shipbuilder had inked a $2.1-billion deal with General Dynamics. \r\nSeparately, Northrop said third-quarter earnings fell 22% because of a large drop in pension fund investments. \r\nPeter Pae \r\nHollywood Production Jobs Fall to 4-Year Low \r\nSkittishness following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks has exacerbated an already slow season in Hollywood, pushing employment in the movie, television and film industry to a four-year low in September, state statistics show. \r\nCutbacks and delayed projects by the major studios has trickled down through the industry, leading to a spate of layoffs at small companies that provide equipment and services for the industry. \r\nMeg James \r\nGrammy Officials Urge Greene Settlement \r\nHigh-ranking officials at the Grammy organization recommended a settlement of more than half a million dollars to resolve sexual assault and battery allegations against the nonprofit group's chief executive, C. Michael Greene, Grammy sources said. \r\nThe proposed settlement, subject to approval by the group's board of directors, has ignited an internal revolt, with at least a dozen of the 41 trustees privately calling for Greene's firing, the sources said. \r\nGreene declined to comment. Attorneys for the Grammy nonprofit group previously denied that Greene assaulted or had any sexual contact with Jill Geimer, the Grammy executive who has threatened to sue over Greene's alleged misconduct. \r\nChuck Philips \r\nEMI Ousts Record Label Executive Nancy Berry \r\nBritish music conglomerate EMI Group sacked Nancy Berry, the vice chairwoman of its worldwide Virgin Records division. \r\nBerry's exit came a week after the London-based record company ousted its global record chief, Ken Berry, who is Nancy Berry's former husband. \r\nThe shake-up follows a dispiriting period for EMI, including a disastrous sales debut from pop icon Mariah Carey, who suffered a nervous breakdown months after signing an $80-million contract with the company this year. Nancy Berry spearheaded the elaborate marketing campaign for Carey's album, \"Glitter,\" which has sold fewer than 400,000 copies since its Sept. 11 debut. \r\nJeff Leeds \r\nManagement Buyout of G&L Realty Approved \r\nStockholders of G&L Realty Corp. approved a management-led buyout of the real estate investment trust despite a higher offer by a rival group and concerns that the deal unfairly favors top executives. \r\nThe company's co-chairmen, Daniel Gottlieb and Steven Lebowitz, plan to take the small Beverly Hills-based company private after a majority of shareholders backed their $12-a-share offer. \r\nThe management-led offer triggered a shareholder lawsuit this year that claimed G&L's board breached its fiduciary duty \r\nJesus Sanchez \r\nInternet Archive Turns Back Web Pages of Time \r\nThe nonprofit Internet Archive launched its so-called Wayback Machine, allowing Web surfers to check out most Internet sites that have vanished and older versions of sites that are still around. \r\nThe San Francisco effort is the brainchild of Brewster Kahle, a millionaire technologist who wants to preserve the Internet's ephemera for generations to come. \r\nLike many Internet pioneers, however, Kahle faces unfamiliar risks along with the opportunities: the archive might be the most massive violation of copyright law since ownership rights over words came into being. \r\nMore than 10 billion pages are available at http://web.archive.org. \r\nJoseph Menn \r\nJob Cuts, Make-Over in Store for Sears \r\nSears, Roebuck & Co. is getting a new look, borrowing from competitors that have been biting into Sears bottom line. \r\nIn a bid the company says will increase operating income by $1 billion during the next three years, Sears will look more like a mass merchant, with more self-serve areas and centralized checkouts. \r\nAs part of its financial realignment, Sears will cut 4,900 jobs in the next 18 months. \r\nThe company's challenge, analysts say, is to offer something unique within its niche of serving middle-income consumers--an ever difficult proposition against innovative rivals such as Kohl's and Target. \r\nAbigail Goldman\r\n\r\nPHOTO: Newport News builds nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.; ; PHOTOGRAPHER: Associated Press; PHOTO: Sears is cutting nearly 5,000 jobs and launching a new strategy.; ; PHOTOGRAPHER: Associated Press; PHOTO: The reeling airline industry is expecting its problems to worsen.; ; PHOTOGRAPHER: Agence France-Presse; GRAPHIC: Dimming Power, Los Angeles Times; \r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Houston skyscrapers bearing the names of Enron, Chevron, Exxon and Shell make significant contributions to the view. \r\nNow another name is being added to the downtown mix, enhancing the energy capital image even further. The 36-story Two Allen Center has been renamed Devon Energy Tower.\r\nDevon Energy has just signed a lease for 193,000 square feet of space, more than doubling its presence in the building, and as part of the deal, Devon gets to put its name on the structure. \r\nThe lease also gives Oklahoma City-based Devon the right to take more space in the 1 million-square-foot building, at 1212 Smith St. \r\nDevon recently announced its plans to acquire Mitchell Energy & Development, but it will maintain Mitchell's offices in The Woodlands, said Klay Kimker, manager of office administration for Devon. \r\nKevin Snodgrass and Tim Relyea of Cushman & Wakefield represented Devon in the transaction. Paul Frazier and Margaret Sigur negotiated the deal on behalf of TrizecHahn Office Properties, the owner of the building. \r\nTrizecHahn owns both the Allen Center and Cullen Center office complexes, a total of 6 million square feet of space in downtown. The TrizecHahn office space is nearly full right now, but Enron will be vacating large amounts of space there next year when the nearby Enron building is complete. \r\nTeamsters to build facilities \r\nTeamsters Union officials are planning to build new headquarters facilities after the union sells its building on the Katy Freeway. \r\nTo replace the Katy Freeway building, the union expects to build two smaller structures near Bush Intercontinental Airport to house different chapters, said A.W. Parker, secretary treasurer of Local 968. \r\nParker's group is expecting to build a 13,000-square-foot building at Ella Boulevard at Beltway 8. \r\nAnother Teamsters group has purchased 4.5 acres on Beltway 8 at Diplomatic Plaza Drive, in the World Houston Business Center. The land was purchased from the Licha Family Trust. Tony Patronella and Marc Drumwright, both of Southwest Realty Advisors, handled the sale. \r\nChicago firm buying property \r\nA Chicago real estate investment firm is on a quest to acquire suburban office buildings in Houston. \r\nML Capital Ventures has purchased two small office structures: the 71,736-square-foot building at 5500 Northwest Central Drive and the 66,338-square-foot building at 5301 Hollister. The building on Northwest Central Drive is the headquarters of BJ Services energy company. \r\nMike Luecht, president of ML Capital, said his firm will acquire two additional Houston office buildings before the end of the year. \r\nML Capital, which has been in business for eight months, will exceed Luecht's initial plan to buy more than $22 million worth of suburban office space in Houston in the company's start-up phase. \r\nLuecht said his firm was bullish on two types of real estate: buying warehouses in Chicago and buying office buildings in suburban Houston. Houston's economy has been adding jobs and it is a promising market that is overlooked by many investors, Luecht said. Many investors have been too slow to forget the devastating meltdown of Houston realty market in the 1980s, Luecht said. \r\nIn its most recent deal, ML Ventures bought the 5500 Northwest Central building in partnership with Avgeris & Associates of Chicago. Tom Bousquet of CB Richard Ellis brokered the deal. \r\nWoodlands opens new section \r\nSeveral $1 million home sites go up for sale this weekend as The Woodlands opens a new section of its Carlton Woods gated community. \r\nThe premium lots will be facing the new Jack Nicklaus Signature golf course. \r\nCustom lots will range in price from $150,000 to $1 million and range in size from one-fifth of an acre to two-and-three-fourths acres. \r\nThe Carlton Woods community is the first gated community in The Woodlands and has been well received by upper-end home buyers, said Paul Lazzaro, vice president of marketing for The Woodlands. \r\nThirty-two homes are under construction in Carlton Woods and all of them are priced at more than $1 million. \r\nA total of 208 lots have been sold in Carlton Woods, which opened about a year ago.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents. \r\nThe move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks normally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion. \r\nEnron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below investment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an early default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will be able to sell more commercial paper. \r\nEnron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed that its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will show a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wednesday. \r\nThe stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked questions about its accounting practices.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bond prices at these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for bankruptcy. \r\nLate on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to buy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the company on negative watch. \r\nCommercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis. \r\n\"What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners that they are creditworthy and continue with business,\" said Robin West, chairman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. \"In a situation like this, cash is king.\" \r\nEnron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterparties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business. \r\nIf Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that. \r\nSo far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up well. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company could still be severely damaged by the scandal. \r\nEnron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its most recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer. \r\nEnron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity investments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a certain level. \r\nThose investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which should have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed. \r\nThe complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the same balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered from marking their private equity investments to market. \r\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.\r\nInvestors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. \r\n\"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,\" said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. \"People are questioning the credibility of management.\" \r\nThe company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. \r\nThe price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%. \r\nInvestors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions. \r\nEnron's decision to tap its credit line was \"a smart financial move,\" said Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. \"It took away the hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capital.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But last week when the company reported a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, new questions began to arise. \r\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement launched an informal inquiry into the partnerships, and earlier this week Fastow was put on a leave of absence. \r\nNow Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for companies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually slightly better than what banks offer, and often with more flexible terms. \r\n\"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the capital markets, which look at it negatively,\" said Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P.

It first struck me as another one of these strangely timed actions on the part of management.\" \r\nJeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to continue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned. \r\nIn a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies to consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, which would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to the company and cut back on business with it. \r\n\"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues,\" Dietert wrote in a report Friday. \"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off.\" \r\nFeygin said he also believes the company will continue to do better in revealing its financial dealings but thinks there may be more surprises in store. \r\nFor example, a Wall Street Journal article Friday discussed for the first time another business entity with ties to Enron known as Chewco. It was formed in 1997 with about $400 million in financial backing to buy interests in unnamed Enron assets. \r\nChewco was run by Michael Kopper, a managing director of Enron's Global Equity Markets Group.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron's broadband network would link MSN customers in over two dozen states, including Texas.\r\nQwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other states for MSN. \r\nOn Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if it didn't provide an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, according to Bloomberg News.

The F.B.I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani than waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactly zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (though one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). The Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had begun until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpeted breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcement that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New Jersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary-school children again.\r\nGiven that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things That Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not everything changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20. \r\nThis is an administration that will let its special interests -- particularly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic prudence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as speedily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmaceutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a panacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's House ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush campaign cash machine. \r\nAirport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, ServiceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates, is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat cats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Hall Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thousands of their employees. \r\nTo see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes back to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ridge. \r\nMr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam. A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administration from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various jobs, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right because he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- who have brought us where we are today. \r\nThe farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. Ashcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perhaps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics override public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the patriotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern. \r\nPre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credibility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lines it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibility by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance of science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is requesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospitals -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of all expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the Republican Bill Frist. \r\nIt should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of public health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointee, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June report on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr. Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gulag. \r\nAs for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand information about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, which has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim necessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has sought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has never been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Glazier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even though her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international and domestic terrorism.'' \r\nMs. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't respond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she adds, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents). \r\nIf either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human services inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, there wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of homeland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 government agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to define Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it was ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing still more confusion. \r\nThe one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Brokaw -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers. That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision for any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment. \r\nSince the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we can only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Taliban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''instead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appears to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.'' \r\nMaybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or politics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & Shoulders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reassuring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.\r\n\r\nDrawing \r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

He still held 2.8m shares until July.\r\nOther executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron declined to comment on the share sales. \r\nMr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to \"dispel uncertainty in the financial community\" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enron's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep another $800,000 in cash. He said: \"We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community.\" \r\nThe company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission into partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. \r\nMr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to restore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong. \r\nEnron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called \"failed investments\".\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That six month period expires on November 19. \r\nHouston-based Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indian government. \r\nTIME RUNNING OUT \r\nThe Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would also discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after November 19. \r\n\"It is one of the items on the agenda,\" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying. \r\nThe paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. \r\n\"The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands down,\" the paper added. \r\nA Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. \r\nThe source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far. \r\nThe Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity, but two Indian companies, BSES Ltd and Tata Power Ltd , have shown interest. \r\nThey have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount. \r\nLocal business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 percent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel. \r\nEnron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $1 billion, the paper added. \r\nOfficials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment. \r\n($1=48.00 Indian rupees).\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner. \r\n\"We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron, as quickly as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other providers,\" Visse said. \r\nEnron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing company policy on pending litigation. Enron, based in Houston, is the largest energy trader. \r\nEnron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow Jones news wire reported. \r\nEnron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of the deal, Dow reported. \r\nAlternative browser-users denied Microsoft entry \r\nNEW YORK -- Microsoft's premier Web portal, MSN.com, denied entry to millions of people who use alternative browser software such as Opera and told them to get Microsoft's products instead. \r\nThe decision led to complaints from the small but loyal Opera community that Microsoft was abusing its status as the Internet's browser leader. Microsoft later backed off and said yesterday that it would support the other browsers after all. \r\nBrowser products affected by the shutout, which was triggered by a face-lift of the MSN.com Web site, included Opera, Mozilla and Amaya, said Kevin Reichard, editorial manager for Internet.com's BrowserWatch site. \r\nMike Pettit, president of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft group, urged state and federal investigators to look into the matter as part of its lawsuit accusing Microsoft of anti-competitive practices. \r\n-- The Associated Press \r\nMicrosoftSF to shut down; Sony will run retail store \r\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Sony will take over a retail store it manages with Microsoft next month, when the biggest software maker's Xbox goes up against Sony's PlayStation 2 in a contest for control of the $20 billion video-game market, a Sony spokeswoman said. \r\nThe two companies agreed to shut down MicrosoftSF, a retail outlet in Sony's San Francisco Metreon entertainment complex. It will be replaced with a Digital Solutions electronics store run by Sony on Thursday, Metreon spokeswoman Kirsten Maynard said. \r\nIn April 1998, the companies said they would open the store that displays and sells Microsoft products alongside Sony electronics that run the software. In March 2000, Microsoft announced the Xbox, a game console with an advanced-graphics chip that goes on sale Nov. 15. \r\n\"A lot has changed with both companies,\" Maynard said. \"It sort of became not-a-fit anymore.\" \r\nSony Metreon won't carry the Xbox or Game Cube, a new video console from Nintendo that goes on sale Nov. 19, she said. Officials at Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment on the shutdown. \r\n-- Bloomberg News \r\nCopyright [copyright] Seattle Times Company, All Rights Reserved.

Emshwiller\r\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nA3\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nEnron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major energy-trading companies. \r\nInvestors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, with annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billion, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's traded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operation, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in transactions.\r\n\"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. \"There's not a trader out there that doesn't use EnronOnline.\" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid. \r\nEnron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar with the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions. \r\nWhile Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. \"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement. \r\nEnron said Mr. Fastow \"will be on a leave of absence from the company.\" He couldn't be reached for comment. \r\nIt remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at nearly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-active stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stock. \r\nEnron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier this year, the stock was above $80 a share. \r\nIn an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies, which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, Dynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles. \r\nPrudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could be seen as evidence that \"management does care\" about investor concerns. However, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming as it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as \"an admission of guilt.\" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron largely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financial structure. \r\nEnron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings. \r\nWorries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible \"death spiral\" in which increasing credit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any evidence of such a problem. \r\nHowever, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities. Enron is facing a problem with \"trust and credibility. It's not easy to regain something as basic as trust,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Looks at Dealings\r\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe New York Times\r\nPage 2, Column 5\r\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\r\n\r\nThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\n''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''\r\nThe company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer. \r\nEnron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night. \r\nThe move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it. \r\nOn Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions. \r\nThe fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand. \r\nBy structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address. \r\nConcerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either in cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate. \r\nMr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75. \r\nAccording to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said. \r\nShares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours trading, they fell to $16.14. \r\nOne of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell'' from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Monday. \r\n''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yesterday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.'' \r\nBut she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People could fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get any answers.''\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The partnerships have been dissolved. \r\nhttp://www.washingtonpost.com \r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The company said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares. \r\nEnron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quarter earnings on Oct 16. \r\nThe earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enron's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment. \r\nThe partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron, served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments. \r\nBut Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time. \r\nSo Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also ended its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enron took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. \r\nTuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a \"Chinese wall\" existed between Enron and LJM. \r\nFastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer before moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up the company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortable with the Fastow-LJM setup. \r\nEnron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available for comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving a salary. \r\nEnron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \"informal inquiry\" into the LJM dealings. \r\nThe news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling in August for personal reasons. \r\nA continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followed the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry. \r\nWall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations. \r\nBeyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partnerships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities. \r\nInvestors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business. \r\nIn the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38. \r\nWednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, which closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets. \r\nA conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with analysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped. \r\nOn Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, moved from a \"hold\" to a \"sell\" rating. \r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief.\r\nBy JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY.\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\r\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price. \r\nEnron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.\r\nKenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off. \r\nThat loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the partnerships established with Mr Fastow. \r\nAnalysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earlier served as Enron's treasurer. \r\nAnalysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough. Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demonstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called for Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those calls. \r\nMs Coale issued a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. \"We are concerned about what we don't know,\" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure. \r\nEnron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong.

All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\nEnron \r\nTo lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chief financial officer as well looks like carelessness.\r\nEnron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in its third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1.2bn equity charge related to the closing of \"related party transactions\" with two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention that the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest anyone? \r\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. Investors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so after its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposite effect. \r\nThe charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes receivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. The uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack of disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlikely to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for shareholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief executive, who quit after only six months as CEO). But the credibility problem goes beyond one individual. \r\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved. \r\nhttp://www.ft.com.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued\r\nby Houston-based Enron during the summer.\r\n\r\n     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy\r\nFastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people\r\nare about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent\r\nconference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in\r\nterms of calming investors' concerns.''\r\n\r\n     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has\r\ngot this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,\r\nand he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is\r\nrealizing just how concerned investors are.''\r\n\r\n     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that\r\nit could extend. You never know what could come of that.''\r\n\r\n     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with\r\nthe SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset\r\nwrite-downs.''\r\n\r\n     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of\r\ndisclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third\r\nquarter.''\r\n\r\n     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet\r\nwith your results?

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nHOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list investors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the company stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. \r\n\"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC,\" Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. \"Who knows?\"\r\nEnron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Monday's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by Fastow. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed Wednesday. \r\nFastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, who has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets group, takes over his role. \r\n\"I think change is good at this particular point in time,\" said FAC Equities analyst Robert Christensen said. \"I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered.\" \r\nA.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships. \r\n\"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,\" Heim said. \r\nReplacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added. \r\n\"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community,\" Heim said. \"Instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever.\" \r\nEnron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 per share, a 17 percent decline. \r\nSince the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week, Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent. \r\n\"The market was asking for that to happen,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said of Fastow's departure. \"This is really the first time Enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis.\" \r\nPreviously, Enron's managers have been \"cautious and defensive in their approach,\" he said. \r\nDuring a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have since been dissolved. \r\nThe call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim. \r\n\"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever expect to take any more charges,\" Heim said. \"What I heard is we don't have to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed.\" \r\nThe turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third quarter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's future, Heim said. \r\n\"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now, two years from now,\" he said. \r\nBut much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, Feygin said. \r\nFeygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer. \r\n\"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the partnerships),\" Feygin said. \"Three days ago I would have said there is no need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was something Enron needed to do.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nFacing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble. \r\nAfter failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conference call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasurer Jeff McMahon.\r\nThe move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. The stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion of shareholder wealth. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said. \r\nEarly last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, resulting from US$1.01-billion in write-offs. \r\nThe company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow. \r\nIn July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently looking into the partnership arrangement. \r\nThe turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors. \r\nDuring the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships. \r\nThe stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this week, to \"sell\" from \"hold.\" Ms. Coale said the rating change is \"not because of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't know about the company.\" \r\nVolume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average daily volume is 6.7 million shares. \r\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's line during the conference call. \r\nThe company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder equity. But Mr. Feygin said management was \"defensive\" when pressed for details. \r\nMs. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad news was to come. \r\nWhile the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the company's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term fortunes. \r\nLast week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's lowered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Third-quarter charges of $1.01 billion from failed investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped out 70% of the profit earned in the last four quarters. \r\n\"Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to Andy,\" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded Enron to \"long-term buy\" and owns no shares. \r\nFastow, 39, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million in third-quarter losses. \r\nEnron also bought back 62 million shares from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment. \r\nDuring a conference call Tuesday, Lay said, \"I and Enron's board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as CFO.\" \r\nEnron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock closed down $3.38, or 17%, to $16.41 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, setting a new 52-week low. \r\nThe SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday. Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received. \r\nThe company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office indicate.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As details of this deal, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54% in just seven days. \r\nWednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group. \r\nHow might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to show that the \"Fastow era\" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2. \r\nClearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct. \r\nNot much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company? \r\nThe spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence. \r\nEnron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board. \r\nIn fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed the LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders. \r\nLay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency. \r\nAny efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management? \r\n\r\n\r\nPhew!

Did it create a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoarding it, perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled? Did we wipe out billions in equity of utilities in some sort of bizarre zero-sum game in which Enron won it all and shareholders from California utilities lost? \r\nAnd was Enron at the hub of a vast power conspiracy to screw the U.S. consumer? \r\nSomehow, I believe that if it weren't for the events of Sept. 11 and its aftermath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department antitrust division or a Congressional investigation. To me, this one smells worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time. \r\nAnd we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to the bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history. \r\nWe ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treble damages that violators owe. \r\nWhat surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want to make his name blowing this one wide open. \r\nThis nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abandon the white-collar folks, either. \r\nThere was just too much money lost too fast for what, in an era where energy seems pretty plentiful, couldn't possibly, in retrospect, be considered a real shortage. \r\nRandom musings: See you on CNBC'S \"Squawk,\" where I will, if given the chance, talk about Viacom (VIA^B:NYSE - news - commentary) , ChevronTexaco (CVX:NYSE - news - commentary) , United Technologies (UTX:NYSE - news - commentary) and Wells Fargo (WFC:NYSE - news - commentary) , all of which have some nice cyclicality to them, which is what is called for at this very moment. \r\n\r\n\r\nSmall-Stock Focus: Russell 2000 Ekes Out Increase; Adtran, Arris Group Post Gains\r\nBy Karen Talley\r\nDow Jones Newswires\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nC6\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK -- It was a day for small-cap stocks to hug the baseline -- barely moving -- before ending the day with a slight gain as a number of positive profit reports pitched them onto positive ground. \r\nThe Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks rose 0.28 point, or 0.07%, to 427.65, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 27.10, or 1.59%, to 1731.54.\r\nGiven small caps' modest advance, their finishing the day higher hardly was guaranteed. For a while, in fact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues and blue chips, although there were moments when these stocks, too, slipped into negative territory. \r\nThe day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and investors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not. \r\nGenerally for small caps, \"It's `where do we go from here' time,\" said Andrew Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot of small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market reopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons to be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. \"Now, it seems the whole market is looking for direction.\" \r\nOn the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, with 1.321 billion advancing and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced decliners by 1,902 to 1,628. \r\nIt was tech all the way among the day's top performers. \r\nCommunications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and networking firms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.2%, to 23.97, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Networks added 93 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17. \r\nSemiconductors were the session's second-best presenters with, among small caps, Elantec Semiconductor adding 3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.80. \r\nWireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-cap Nextel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after posting a third-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued firmness in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps, AirGate PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78. \r\nThe day's poorest performers were natural-gas utilities, which continued to be dragged down by large cap Enron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedmont Natural Gas fell 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 30.63, and Peoples Energy shed 56 cents, or 1.4%, to 39.06. \r\nPegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Cambridge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even stronger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estimate by 10 cents a share. \r\nPinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. The Mountain View, Calif., video-production-system maker had a fiscal first-quarter loss of 11 cents a share before items, beating Wall Street expectations by eight cents a share. Thomas Weisel upgraded shares to `buy' from `market perform.' \r\nSybase jumped 1.99, or 17%, to 13.50. The Emeryville, Calif., online-software developer reported 20 cents a share in earnings before items, beating Wall Street's expectations by two cents a share. \r\nIn a follow-on offering, AmeriPath gained 2.24, or 8.4%, to 29.04 after offering 4.125 million shares at $26 each. The follow-on, as is the custom, was priced at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80. \r\nMerger activity had a positive effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3.38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Billerica, Mass., semiconductor-equipment maker signed a definitive agreement to be bought by Brooks Automation for about $380 million in stock. Under the accord, which was approved by both companies' boards, PRI shareholders will receive 0.52 Brooks share for each PRI share held. Brooks Automation fell 1.31, 3.9%, to 31.80. \r\nVysis surged 7.26, or 31%, to 30.26. The Downers Grove, Ill., genetic-disease researcher agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $30.50 a share, or $355 million. Abbott rose 38 cents to 54.24. \r\nONI Systems dropped 1.01, or 15%, to 5.62. The San Jose, Calif., maker of fiber-optic communication equipment met analysts' third-quarter consensus estimate of 19 cents a share, excluding items, but said its fourth-quarter loss will range between 16 cents and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $40 million to $50 million, when analysts were expecting a loss of 16 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $50.1 million.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's co-founder said yesterday. \r\nIn a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.\r\n\"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Ms. Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. \r\nPlanned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. \r\nOnly directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. \r\nMs. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. \r\nTheir latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. \r\n\"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. \r\nThe corporate governance movement, since its beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. \r\nOne example would be Enron Corp., whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow said. \r\n\"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here.\" \r\nTaking the corporate governance argument a step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. \r\n\"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said. \r\nInstitutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. \r\n\"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,\" said Peter Gleason, vice-president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. \r\nSurveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. \"More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,\" Mr. Gleason said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Computer giant IBM traded on the Instinet electronic brokerage at $108.85, marginally up from its official close of $108.57, while dealers said network giant Cisco Systems was quoted near to its close of $17.23.\r\nEnergy company Enron Corp. found some support in Europe after tumbling after the bell on Wall Street, as the company said it replaced its chief financial officer, who had been linked to transactions being looked at by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nDealers said Enron was bid in Europe at around Wednesday's regular close of $16.41, even though it fell to $16.14 on Instinet late on Wednesday. \"At least they (Enron) seem to have addressed the issue,\" one dealer in U.S. shares said. \r\nU.S. futures were mixed, as European bourses drifted prior to a decision on euro-zone interest rates at 1145 GMT. By 1034 GMT the S&P 500 December futures contract was down 1.5 points at 1,083.5. \r\nOne dealer said investors appeared to be holding back before assessing the impact of an economic stimulus package approved by Congress late on Wednesday. \r\nThe U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a package designed to inject $100 billion into the economy over the next year through business tax breaks and other aid. \r\nSeveral companies reported results after New York's close on Wednesday, but there was limited interest and values remained near to their after-hours prices. \r\nChiron Inc. surged to $48.37 from its close of $47 after the biotechnology firm posted higher earnings as product sales jumped 49 percent. \r\nComverse Technology Inc. , a software and systems provider, slumped to $16.60 in after-hours trading, from its close of $17.58, after warning its earnings would fall.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The move follows Tuesday's conference call, which was an attempt by Enron to restore investor confidence in the company.\r\n\"Andy Fastow was a very well-regarded, low profile individual at Enron, and he's been unfairly pilloried in the press,\" said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. \"But the weight of circumstantial evidence and the material stock price decline made this inevitable.\"\r\nOlson predicted the CFO swap would improve Enron's credibility with Wall Street.\r\nA rough week\r\nEnron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved. \r\nEnron said Fastow had taken a leave of absence and that McMahon, most recently chairman and CEO of the industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000, would take over.\r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Lay, in a statement.\r\nKaren Denne, a spokesperson for Enron, said numerous discussions Tuesday and Wednesday led to the decision. She said she did not know when Fastow would return. \r\nShares of Enron fell more than 17 percent Wednesday to $16.41, then fell further in late trading following the announcement, to as low as $16.18. At one point during the trading day, the shares were trading at a six-year low of $15.51. \r\nAnalysts deliver blows\r\nOlson called Tuesday's conference call a \"missed opportunity,\" saying Enron had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had become more \"forthright and open.\"\r\n\"Unfortunately Enron is overloaded with lawyers,\" said Olson, who has not recommended the stock until recently. \"This company has been very much abused and maligned by people on Wall Street. They have some excellent businesses, and they have been carrying some losers.\" Enron has \"an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses, and excellent surplus cash flow,\" Olson said.\r\nEnron expects to generate $3 billion of cash flow this year, and with $500 million devoted to dividends and $1 billion to maintenance capital spending, the company will have $1.5 billion free.\r\nSeveral Wall Street firms cut their ratings on Enron shares Wednesday, including Prudential Securities. The firm advised clients to sell the stock, a rare recommendation. Prudential had rated the company's shares a \"hold.\" \r\n\"After much consideration, we are lowering our rating ... not because of things we know but because of things we potentially don't know about the company,\" wrote Prudential analyst Carol Coale in a note. \r\nOn Monday, Enron announced that related-party transactions within the limited partnerships are under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Several shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed.\r\n\"Management used the SEC inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the issue at hand, the LJM transactions,\" Coale said in reference to the conference call. \r\nOlson said it's unlikely that Enron, with its coterie of lawyers, would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles, but as to whether it was \"right,\" he conceded it was probably not.\r\nJ.P. Morgan's Anatol Feygin downgraded his rating to \"long-term buy\" from \"buy,\" saying an upgrade is precluded until the company provides more information about its liabilities. \r\n\"Management's conference call yesterday was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns,\" Feygin wrote. \r\nMerrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey noted Wednesday that if Enron isn't able to maintain its investment-grade ratings -- the company's debt is on watch for a potential downgrade by Moody's Investors Service -- issuing new equity would be one course of action, though with the potential to reduce earnings-per-share. Enron on Tuesday held with its forecast of $1.80 a share for 2001. \r\n\"New equity would potentially dilute our EPS estimates 5 to 10 percent,\" Eassey wrote in a follow-up to the conference call. \r\nBut Eassey believes that cash flow from operations -- expected to exceed $3 billion in 2002 -- along with asset sales, should be enough to \"insulate\" the company's credit ratings.\r\nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA: UPDATE 1-Beleaguered Enron names new CFO.\r\nBy Jeff Franks\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nReuters English News Service\r\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\r\n\r\nHOUSTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , trying to halt a freefall in its stock price and a firestorm of criticism from Wall Street, named a new chief financial officer on Wednesday to replace Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators. \r\nThe company, which is the nation's largest energy trader, said Fastow would take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jeff McMahon, who has been running an Enron unit and is the company's former treasurer, in a bid to restore credibility with investors.\r\nFastow's departure follows the August resignation of chief executive Jeff Skilling, who said he wanted a change in lifestyle after just six months on the job. \r\nWednesday's change came after Enron's stock fell $3.38 to $16.41, its lowest point in six years, to cap off a $13 billion plunge in market value since the company announced a third quarter loss last week and wrote down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in a move related to the questionable transactions. \r\nWall Street's anxieties about Enron spread to the stocks of other natural gas and power traders and marketers on Wednesday, with Dynegy Inc. falling 12.8 percent to $37.26 and Aquila Inc. off 11.7 percent at $21.20. \r\nInvestors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. \r\nWall Street analysts who once touted the company have bitterly accused it of not being forthcoming about the matter, a problem Enron chief executive Ken Lay cited in his appointment of McMahon. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" he said in a statement. \r\nMcMahon, who was treasurer from 1998 to 2000 before becoming chief executive officer of Enron's Industrial Markets group, has a \"deep and thorough understanding of Enron\" and the confidence of the investment world, Lay said. \r\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that it was McMahon who first spoke up about the perception of impropriety in the limited partnership arrangements made by Fastow. The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. \r\nFastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues because of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against the company. \r\nAs recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a corporate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money machine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodities. \r\nBut some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an Indian power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation. \r\nThere also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements had become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. \r\nAnalysts said the replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but not a panacea for its credibility problems. \r\n\"The problems investors are having with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnership arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those concerns,\" said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. \r\n\"I don't think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these partnerships,\" he said. \"I still have a lot of questions.\" \r\nAndre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not that helpful. \r\n\"Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that clears up the picture,\" he said. \"Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have clean hands when it comes to these transactions.\" \r\n\"The fear driving the market is: if this is what we know, how much worse can it get?\" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Closest was Dynegy Inc. which closed with a loss of $5.45, or 12.76 percent, at $37.26 - its lowest price in three weeks. \r\nPOWER EARNINGS FORECASTS TRIMMED \r\nThe talk of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and trading came from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - American Electric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. and PPL Corp. . \r\nEarly Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, change in earnings per share next year from this year, citing expectations of lower profits on power sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The company also confirmed it still sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share. \r\nNoting PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia Securities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to \"market perform\" from \"strong buy\" explaining PPL's \"failure to differentiate itself from the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility. \r\n\"The company will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to be afforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks,\" he concluded. \r\nDeutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar downgrades in Exelon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectations. \r\nSTOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES \r\n\"The primary driver (for the 2002 estimate) is lower wholesale commodity price assumptions at (the company's generation unit), in addition to weaker distribution demand\" at Exelon's utility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chicago, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday. \r\nExelon officials noted, in answer to analyst questions, that the view of 2002 demand had changed to negative from flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. \r\nThe company's stock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the earnings release early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares continued to advance Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers among the 40 S&P Utility Index components. \r\nThe big loser among the integrated utilities - those which produce and distribute power - was PPL, which ended the day at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 percent. \r\nLosses of about 1.3 percent were posted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, which slipped 52 cents to $39.48. \r\nAEP \"management cautioned that the slowing economy may make the upper end (of its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to $3.90) more difficult to achieve,\" Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrote in a note that maintained his estimate. \r\nHe lowered his estimate of PSEG 2002 earnings per share 5 cents to $4.05 while awaiting the closing of a Peruvian purchase and pointed out it receives more for electricity than most PJM power producers because of restraints on the delivery of Midwest electricity to New Jersey's power hungry markets.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(\"Enron\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: ENE) and its principal officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through and including October 18, 2001, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). \r\nThe complaint alleges that Enron and its principal officers and directors violated Section 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of l934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaint alleges that defendants misled investors (1) by reporting assets that were overvalued by more than $1 billion, which caused writedowns in that amount and are expected to lead to further writeoffs of hundreds of millions of dollars, (2) by concealing facts regarding relationships with a related entity that led to a more than $1 billion reduction of shareholders' equity and a $35 million charge, and (3) by obfuscating or failing to disclose the fact that agreements with other related entities satisfaction of which include obligations that may require the Company to issue large amounts of its shares. This misconduct caused the market prices of Enron stock to be artificially inflated during the Class Period. When facts about these matters were disclosed at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Company's per share stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the Company's stock despite the precurietous fall in its market price. Also, Enron's senior debt was placed on notice by Moody's for possible downgrade.\r\nAlso, an SEC inquiry into the Company's transactions with related entities has been announced, and the Company revealed that its Chief Financial Officer, who is one of the Defendants, has taken a \"leave of absence\" from the Company, and has been replaced. \r\nIf you purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through October 18, 2001, inclusive, you may, no later than December 21, 2001 move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff.

Enron\r\nagreed to renegotiate the terms of the transaction to let LJM2 buy\r\nthe shares two months early.\r\n\r\n    That let the partnership earn a $10.5 million in profit, the\r\nsuit says. If the transaction had not been renegotiated, the\r\npartnership would have lost $8 for every share it sold in\r\nSeptember, the suit alleges.\r\n\r\n                           `Bailed Out'\r\n\r\n     ``Mr. Fastow and LJM2 took advantage of inside information to\r\nreap illicit insider trading profits, in the millions of dollars\r\nin this transaction alone,'' the suit says.\r\n\r\n     At the same time that the LJM2 transaction was being\r\nrenegotiated in December and January, Chief Executive Officer\r\nKenneth Lay, President Mark Frevert and other top managers sold\r\nthe $73 million in shares, the suit alleges.\r\n\r\n     Enron executives ``bailed out of shares... reaping huge\r\ninsider trading profits,'' the lawsuit says.\r\n\r\n     Other sellers included former CEO Jeff Skilling, Chief\r\nStrategy Officer Cliff Baxter, broadband services CEO Ken Rice,\r\nChief of Staff Steve Kean, pipeline group CEO Stanley Horton and\r\nChief Risk Officer Richard Buy, the suit says.\r\n\r\n     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the\r\nlawsuit.\r\n\r\n     ``We haven't been served (notice of the suit), and it's our\r\npolicy not to talk about pending litigation,'' she said\r\n\r\n     In March, spokesman Mark Palmer said the executives exercised\r\nstock options that would have expired worthless otherwise.\r\n\r\n     Enron has formed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and\r\nsell company assets, according to records from the Texas secretary\r\nof state. The Houston-based company reported $1.01 billion in\r\nthird-quarter losses, including $35 million from the LJM\r\npartnerships run by Fastow.\r\n\r\n                            SEC Inquiry\r\n\r\n     Greenberg says directors shouldn't have allowed Fastow to run\r\npartnerships that bought and sold company assets.\r\n\r\n     Shares of Enron have fallen 52 percent in the past six days\r\non investor concern about the liabilities attached to partnerships\r\nand affiliated companies formed by Enron to remove debt from its\r\nbooks.

Third-quarter losses of $1.01 billion from failed\r\ninvestments outside the main commodities trading business wiped\r\nout 70 percent of the profit earned in the past four quarters.\r\n\r\n     ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to\r\nAndy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded\r\nEnron to ``long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.\r\n\r\n     As Enron treasurer, McMahon complained to then-Enron\r\nPresident Jeffrey Skilling about potential conflicts of interest\r\nposed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street Journal\r\nreported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the\r\nJournal said, citing people familiar with the matter.\r\n\r\n     ``McMahon was made famous under Skilling by going to him and\r\nobjecting to the partnerships,'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was\r\ntransferred out of the treasurer function into Enron Net Works,''\r\nwhich oversees Enron's Internet trading system.\r\n\r\n                       `An Outstanding Job'\r\n\r\n     Fastow, 39 years old, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,\r\ntwo partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's\r\ninvolvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million\r\nin third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares\r\nfrom LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.\r\n\r\n     On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's\r\nboard of directors continue to have the highest faith and\r\nconfidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as\r\nCFO.''\r\n\r\n      Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock\r\nclosed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in today's trading.\r\n\r\n      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday.\r\nSpokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron\r\nis cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.\r\n\r\n     The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships\r\nand corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as\r\npower plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\n     The Texas records list dozens of Enron executives as officers\r\nand directors of company-related partnerships. None of them have\r\nany financial interest in the partnerships after Fastow severed\r\nties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.\r\n\r\n                        `Zero Compensation'\r\n\r\n     ``The managers in these affiliates listed as managing members\r\nare representational in nature only,'' he said. ``They get zero\r\ncompensation.''\r\n\r\n     The LJM partnerships were different. Enron's board allowed\r\nFastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years, to run them\r\nand earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested,\r\nthe Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a\r\nshareholder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships\r\nreworked an agreement with Enron to avoid taking big losses.\r\n\r\n     Enron is obligated to repay $3.3 billion associated with two\r\nother partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, if they can't raise\r\nenough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, Enron\r\nspokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when\r\nasked if the partnerships will generate enough cash.\r\n\r\n     ``The concern now isn't just with the LJM partnership, it's\r\nmore with the other partnerships, such as Osprey and Marlin,''\r\nsaid A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a ``hold'' rating on\r\nEnron and owns no shares.\r\n\r\n                       High Level Departures\r\n\r\n     Enron has lost several senior executives in the past two\r\nyears. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the\r\njob, citing personal reasons and frustration with declines in the\r\ncompany's stock price. Enron Corp. Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton\r\nleft the company in November as the company switched its focus\r\nfrom developing assets to energy and commodity trading.\r\n\r\n     Rebecca Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S.\r\nbusiness, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of\r\nAzurix Corp., a water company formed by Enron Corp. Mark also\r\nresigned from Enron's board.\r\n\r\n     Azurix was a money-losing investment. Enron sold shares in\r\nthe water company to the public that it later had to buy back.\r\n\r\n--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***********\r\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes\r\nare currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the\r\nplacing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by\r\nFitch.\r\n\r\nThe rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund\r\naccount (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron\r\nin the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The\r\noverfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated\r\n'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service\r\ninterest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies\r\non Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible\r\npreferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred\r\nsecurities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the\r\ntransaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan\r\nto Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the\r\nsupport from the assets in the share trust used to support\r\ninterest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to\r\nremarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund\r\nprincipal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock\r\nhas been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets\r\nin the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron\r\nunsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as\r\nquarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible\r\npreferred stock.\r\n\r\nWhile various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or\r\nliquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in\r\neach case primary credit support is derived from the Enron\r\nobligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock\r\nif an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been\r\ndeposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity\r\ndate, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that\r\nthe issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount\r\nrequired to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to\r\ndeliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver\r\non this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then\r\nthe amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of\r\nEnron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note\r\nTrigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured\r\ndebt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies\r\nin conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock\r\nprice over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary\r\nevents of default under the notes. It is important to note that\r\nEnron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate\r\nmarket value to fully pay down the associated debt.\r\n\r\nFitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction\r\nwith the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans\r\n\r\n10/26/2001\r\nCapital Markets Report\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. \r\nLate Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.\r\nEnron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. \r\nTrading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. \r\nThat was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. \r\nMoody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. \r\nEnron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. \r\nAmong the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. \r\nOne distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. \r\nBanks, the investor said, \"are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02,\" the investor said. \r\nAnother fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) \r\n\"As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books,\" this person said. \r\nSome banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. \r\n\"Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that,\" the fixed income official said. \r\n\r\n-By Joe Niedzielski, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-2039; joe.niedzielski@dowjones.com\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. \r\nEnron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.\r\nAfter three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. \r\nIn a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. \r\nThe agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. \r\nMicrosoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. \r\nMicrosoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't provide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have breached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages. \r\nThe suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal. \r\nIn a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's prior approval. \r\nAn Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the release. \r\nA Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN 7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, access to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25. \r\nThe Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver \"state-of-the-art\" video and audio through \"dramatically improved\" broadband technology. The new service would extend MSN broadband service \"to more than 29 million households in 45 markets.\" \r\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households capable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access. \r\nThe Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit. \r\nNeither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. \r\nThe Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet. \r\nThat deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's fiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service. \r\n-By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.com\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills. \r\nISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to \"initiate termination proceedings\" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a letter obtained by the Globe.\r\nAn Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's requirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels. \r\n\"It was an administrative snafu,\" said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Enron. \"It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on time] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on Friday.\" \r\nAccording to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months. \"Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently,\" said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the letter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization \"has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured.\" \r\nBut Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous \"financial assurance\" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. Therefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was the third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the current default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that resulted in the letter. \"We're working with ISO New England to figure that out,\" she said. \r\nThe recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's director of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman of Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization. \r\n\"This is not that unusual within the pool,\" said Allegretti. \"I frequently receive notices of technical defaults.\" As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation, he said, \"We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork.\" \r\nThe incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO. \r\nEnron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Enron lost $618 million in the third quarter. \r\nYesterday, Enron's shares closed at $16.35, down 6 cents, on volume of 39.1 million shares. \r\nJeffrey Krasner can be reached by e-mail at krasner@globe.com.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell critics' concerns \r\nFinancial Times; Oct 26, 2001\r\nBy JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY\r\n\r\nEnron has put up a page on its website of \"frequently asked questions\" in response to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's controversial results announcement. \r\nUnfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with the answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its chief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs. \r\nHowever, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle \"partnerships\". \"It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move,\" says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. \"It's not the end of it.\" \r\nThe shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade lower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars 84.87 until the group improves its transparency. \r\nOne of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement on October 16 concerned \"a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in shareholders' equity\". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news release on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up conference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in the earnings report. \r\nIt has since been called a \"loss\" and a \"write-off\" and Enron's staff have struggled to explain it in plain language. \r\nEnron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles, Enron \"recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These adjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods\". \r\nThe confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nAnalysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might hurt its debt rating. \r\nMr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts. \"I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions,\" said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer. \r\nOther analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. \r\n\"Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them,\" Mr Niles says. Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso said it was facing \"a lot of questions on its accounting practices\". \r\nAdditional reporting by Julie Earle Enron in turmoil: www.ft.com/enron \r\nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)\r\n2001-10-26 14:26 (New York)\r\n\r\nEnron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)\r\n\r\n     (Adds Egan-Jones lowering credit rating in 12th paragraph.)\r\n\r\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares\r\nfell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond\r\nrating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit line\r\nbecause it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.\r\n\r\n     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after\r\ninvestors questioned the company's transactions with affiliated\r\ncompanies run by its former chief financial officer. The stock\r\nfell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.\r\n\r\n     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''\r\nsaid John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed income\r\nassets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who was\r\nsupposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was\r\nrunning partnerships for the benefit of himself.''\r\n\r\n     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-\r\nterm loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company will\r\nuse its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it\r\nhas outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.\r\n\r\n      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009\r\ndeclined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an\r\noffer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating\r\nof ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.\r\n\r\n     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that\r\nthe company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in\r\nthird-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good\r\ncredit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding\r\ncollateral and to settle transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Dilution Concerns\r\n\r\n     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their\r\nyield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds\r\nthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies\r\nwith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back\r\nholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value\r\nof Enron investors' stock.\r\n\r\n     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron\r\nassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to\r\nthe partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. The\r\npartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money\r\ncomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find\r\nthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would\r\nhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell\r\nfor and the amount of the debt.\r\n\r\n     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron\r\npreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would\r\nthin out the holding of every other investor.\r\n\r\n     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's Investors\r\nService has the company on watch for possible downgrade, and\r\nStandard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to\r\nnegative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating on\r\nEnron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.\r\n\r\n                         Other Liabilities\r\n\r\n     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts\r\nto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.\r\n\r\n     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on\r\nWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a\r\npartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct\r\nlosses.

If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, please read this notice. \r\nThe complaint charges the defendants with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose material adverse information and misrepresented the truth about the Company and caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase Enron common stock at artificially inflated prices.\r\nThis action seeks to recover damages on behalf of defrauded investors who purchased Enron securities. Plaintiff is represented by Weiss & Yourman, a law firm possessing significant experience and expertise in prosecuting class actions on behalf of defrauded shareholders in federal and state courts throughout the United States. Weiss & Yourman has been appointed by numerous courts to serve as lead counsel in class action lawsuits and in that capacity has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of investors. \r\nIf you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may move the Court no later than December 21, 2001, to serve as a lead plaintiff of the class. In order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal requirements. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as \"lead plaintiff.\" Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Weiss & Yourman or other counsel of your choice to serve as your counsel in this action. \r\nIf you wish to receive an investor package or if you wish to discuss this action, have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this matter, or if you have any information you wish to provide to us, pleas\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact: \r\nMark D.

Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. \r\nHowever, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.\r\nMr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. \r\nHe said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. \r\n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds\" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. \"But if we are wrong, we will issue equity.\" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. \r\nMaking up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. \r\nDuring the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. \r\nThe turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while \"we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well.\" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. \r\nMr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was \"very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about.\" He added \"we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.\" \r\nInternal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. \r\nDuring the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. \"There's the appearance you are hiding something,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. \"You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board.\" \r\nMr. Lay responded, \"We're trying to be as transparent as we can.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \t\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness/Financial Desk; Section C\r\nEnron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts\r\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nThe New York Times\r\nPage 1, Column 5\r\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\r\n\r\nEnron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. \r\nIn a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.\r\nBut he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. \r\nThe conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. \r\nUntil recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. \r\nOne of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. \r\nAfter the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' \r\nMr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' \r\nMr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. \r\nMr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. \r\nMr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' \r\nMr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. \r\nMr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. \r\nThe large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. \r\nAfter one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. \r\nBuyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. \r\nThe implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. \r\nThe volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. \r\nTo be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. \r\nThe news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. \r\nTuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. \r\nIt remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. \r\nDavid Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. \r\n\"I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,\" he said. \r\nLay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. \r\nHe did say Enron was aware an \"inherent conflict of interest\" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. \r\nIn response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. \r\n\"There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,\" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. \r\nLay and Enron's board continue to have the \"highest faith and confidence\" in Fastow, he added. \r\nFastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. \r\nEnron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. \r\nIt took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. \r\nDuring the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. \r\nThey stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. \r\nIf Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. \r\nJeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. \r\n\"I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVER - Busy signal.\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\r\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited .

A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. \r\nThose investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on. \r\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. \r\nEnron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.\r\nThe report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months.

Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. \r\nShares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. \r\nPower utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. \r\nNevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. \r\n\"Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,\" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. \"Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it.\" \r\nSome seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. \r\nWhatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. \r\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. \r\nInvestors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. \r\nConsumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. \r\nThere were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. \r\nVitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. \r\nNetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. \r\nChartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. \r\nShares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. \r\nEarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. \r\nAT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. \r\nSeveral steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. \r\nMcKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. \r\nWatson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. \r\nFurniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. \r\nIn a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.\r\nA copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. \r\nAES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. \r\nAES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. \r\nIn his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the \"expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management\" by the state government and its agencies.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. \r\nSTOP AND THINK \r\nThe world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. \r\nGolar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. \r\n\"There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,\" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, \"The only risk is things might be delayed.\" \r\nStohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. \r\nGolar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. \r\n\"We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,\" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. \r\nHe said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. \r\n\"It's a good time to wait,\" said Saverys.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Reliance and ONGC, which together own 70\r\npercent of the exploration venture, have both claimed rights to\r\nrun the oil and gas fields.\r\n\r\n     BG has asked ONGC to waive its right to decide the operator\r\nafter Enron quits in return for a stake in its oil and gas sites\r\nin Brazil, the paper said. It didn't give details on the Brazilian\r\ninterests BG may offer ONGC. BG has set Oct. 31 as a deadline to\r\nresolve the ownership dispute, the paper said.\r\n\r\n     The purchase from Enron would give BG a 30 percent stake in\r\nthe Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63\r\npercent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The\r\nassets hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas.\r\n\r\n     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian\r\npartners, ONGC and Reliance, as well as from the nation's biggest\r\nrefiner, Indian Oil Corp.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse stimulus bill would give billions to huge companies; Senate Democrats present alternative\r\nBy CURT ANDERSON\r\nAP Tax Writer\r\n\r\n10/23/2001\r\nAssociated Press Newswires\r\nCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals. \r\nSeven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits.\r\nIBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chain Kroger, $9 million. \r\nIn addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that could total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million. \r\nCounting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief over 10 years. \r\nThe generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly. \r\n\"It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is,\" said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. \r\nFor individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than under the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier. \r\nThe primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation \"is a shot of adrenaline\" that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation. \r\n\"Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy,\" wrote Thomas, R-Calif. \r\nWhile bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid. \r\nThe legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2002, far below the House GOP level. \r\n\"This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly,\" said Baucus, D-Mont. \r\nOther Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines. \r\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending. \r\n\"Everything in this package needs to be stimulative,\" Grassley said. \"There needs to be more done on the investment side.\" \r\n--- \r\nOn the Net: House members: http://www.house.gov/house/MemberWWW.html\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

We had a CEO who basically left without explanation a couple of months ago, then yesterday the CFO has been accused of some pretty strange looking self dealing issues.

Emshwiller\r\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nA3\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nEnron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major energy-trading companies. \r\nInvestors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabilizing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, with annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billion, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's traded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operation, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in transactions.\r\n\"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. \"There's not a trader out there that doesn't use EnronOnline.\" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consistently said it is financially strong and liquid. \r\nEnron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar with the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limited partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transactions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and possibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnerships. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transactions. \r\nWhile Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arrangements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. \"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement. \r\nEnron said Mr. Fastow \"will be on a leave of absence from the company.\" He couldn't be reached for comment. \r\nIt remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increasingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at nearly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-active stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron stock. \r\nEnron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier this year, the stock was above $80 a share. \r\nIn an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies, which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, Dynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A number of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies much different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structured investment vehicles. \r\nPrudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could be seen as evidence that \"management does care\" about investor concerns. However, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming as it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as \"an admission of guilt.\" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron largely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financial structure. \r\nEnron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings. \r\nWorries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the stock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard people voice concerns about a possible \"death spiral\" in which increasing credit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to do business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and lead to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any evidence of such a problem. \r\nHowever, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other entities. Enron is facing a problem with \"trust and credibility. It's not easy to regain something as basic as trust,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Looks at Dealings\r\nBy FLOYD NORRIS\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe New York Times\r\nPage 2, Column 5\r\nc. 2001 New York Times Company\r\n\r\nThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\n''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''\r\nThe company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer. \r\nEnron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night. \r\nThe move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it. \r\nOn Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions. \r\nThe fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand. \r\nBy structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address. \r\nConcerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either in cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate. \r\nMr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75. \r\nAccording to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said. \r\nShares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours trading, they fell to $16.14. \r\nOne of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell'' from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Monday. \r\n''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yesterday evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.'' \r\nBut she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People could fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get any answers.''\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The company said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had done anything improper. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares. \r\nEnron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quarter earnings on Oct 16. \r\nThe earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analysts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enron's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment. \r\nThe partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron, served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments. \r\nBut Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time. \r\nSo Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also ended its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enron took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. \r\nTuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously followed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a \"Chinese wall\" existed between Enron and LJM. \r\nFastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer before moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up the company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortable with the Fastow-LJM setup. \r\nEnron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available for comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving a salary. \r\nEnron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an \"informal inquiry\" into the LJM dealings. \r\nThe news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, water and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling in August for personal reasons. \r\nA continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followed the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry. \r\nWall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various financial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give analysts enough data to make proper evaluations. \r\nBeyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partnerships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entities. \r\nInvestors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current outstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business. \r\nIn the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38. \r\nWednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other companies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, which closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some way end up harming the energy trading markets. \r\nA conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with analysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped. \r\nOn Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, moved from a \"hold\" to a \"sell\" rating. \r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief.\r\nBy JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY.\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\r\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price. \r\nEnron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.\r\nKenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partnerships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off. \r\nThat loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns there may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the partnerships established with Mr Fastow. \r\nAnalysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to confusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earlier served as Enron's treasurer. \r\nAnalysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough. Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demonstrating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called for Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those calls. \r\nMs Coale issued a \"sell\" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. \"We are concerned about what we don't know,\" Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might have to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be forced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose customers to competitors that were not under such pressure. \r\nEnron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove the company has done nothing wrong.

To lose the chief financial officer as well looks like carelessness.\r\nEnron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in its third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1.2bn equity charge related to the closing of \"related party transactions\" with two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention that the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest anyone? \r\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. Investors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so after its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposite effect. \r\nThe charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes receivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. The uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack of disclosure explain the weakness of stock and bond prices. Enron is unlikely to lose its investment grade status, but dilution is a real risk for shareholders. Mr Fastow has gone (following Jeffrey Skilling, former chief executive, who quit after only six months as CEO).

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nHOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list investors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the company stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry. \r\n\"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concern or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of the SEC,\" Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. \"Who knows?\"\r\nEnron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Monday's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did business with Enron while they were managed by Fastow. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed Wednesday. \r\nFastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, who has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets group, takes over his role. \r\n\"I think change is good at this particular point in time,\" said FAC Equities analyst Robert Christensen said. \"I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered.\" \r\nA.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty looming in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships. \r\n\"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last few days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,\" Heim said. \r\nReplacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added. \r\n\"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more transparent to the financial community,\" Heim said. \"Instead of being more transparent there is more confusion than ever.\" \r\nEnron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 per share, a 17 percent decline. \r\nSince the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week, Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent. \r\n\"The market was asking for that to happen,\" J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin said of Fastow's departure. \"This is really the first time Enron has acted as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis.\" \r\nPreviously, Enron's managers have been \"cautious and defensive in their approach,\" he said. \r\nDuring a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no conflict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have since been dissolved. \r\nThe call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim. \r\n\"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever expect to take any more charges,\" Heim said. \"What I heard is we don't have to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed.\" \r\nThe turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third quarter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive officer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's future, Heim said. \r\n\"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company being able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year from now, two years from now,\" he said. \r\nBut much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, Feygin said. \r\nFeygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused McMahon to leave his job as treasurer. \r\n\"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the partnerships),\" Feygin said. \"Three days ago I would have said there is no need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was something Enron needed to do.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nFacing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble. \r\nAfter failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conference call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasurer Jeff McMahon.\r\nThe move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. The stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion of shareholder wealth. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said. \r\nEarly last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, resulting from US$1.01-billion in write-offs. \r\nThe company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow. \r\nIn July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently looking into the partnership arrangement. \r\nThe turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors. \r\nDuring the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships. \r\nThe stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this week, to \"sell\" from \"hold.\" Ms. Coale said the rating change is \"not because of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't know about the company.\" \r\nVolume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average daily volume is 6.7 million shares. \r\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's line during the conference call. \r\nThe company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chief financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder equity. But Mr. Feygin said management was \"defensive\" when pressed for details. \r\nMs. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad news was to come. \r\nWhile the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the company's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term fortunes. \r\nLast week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's lowered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Third-quarter charges of $1.01 billion from failed investments outside the main commodities trading business wiped out 70% of the profit earned in the last four quarters. \r\n\"Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to Andy,\" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded Enron to \"long-term buy\" and owns no shares. \r\nFastow, 39, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, two partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's involvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million in third-quarter losses. \r\nEnron also bought back 62 million shares from LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment. \r\nDuring a conference call Tuesday, Lay said, \"I and Enron's board of directors continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as CFO.\" \r\nEnron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock closed down $3.38, or 17%, to $16.41 in trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, setting a new 52-week low. \r\nThe SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday. Spokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron is cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received. \r\nThe company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships and corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office indicate.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

As details of this deal, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collapsed, falling 54% in just seven days. \r\nWednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that scale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says Fastow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group. \r\nHow might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's alleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to show that the \"Fastow era\" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedly making a lot of money from LJM2. \r\nClearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enron. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's account of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct. \r\nNot much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it took massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding backing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In other words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much further does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at the company? \r\nThe spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was necessary to rebuild investor confidence. \r\nEnron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shadowy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading business makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolation and without the knowledge of the board. \r\nIn fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed the LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broadband business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come from being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it access to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from the downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman responds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders. \r\nLay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an unhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transparency. \r\nAny efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonder people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management? \r\n\r\n\r\nPhew! Enron Stinks\r\nBy James J.

Did it create a short squeeze in energy by buying up all available power and hoarding it, perhaps in a series of partnerships that it controlled? Did we wipe out billions in equity of utilities in some sort of bizarre zero-sum game in which Enron won it all and shareholders from California utilities lost? \r\nAnd was Enron at the hub of a vast power conspiracy to screw the U.S. consumer? \r\nSomehow, I believe that if it weren't for the events of Sept. 11 and its aftermath, these questions would be asked right now by a Justice Department antitrust division or a Congressional investigation. To me, this one smells worse than anything that Microsoft might have done at one time. \r\nAnd we need to give some of these departed Enron execs immunity to get to the bottom of what may have been the greatest antitrust act in history. \r\nWe ought to do it fast, too, while there is some Enron left to pay the treble damages that violators owe. \r\nWhat surprises me is that some enterprising young prosecutor doesn't want to make his name blowing this one wide open. \r\nThis nation must stop at nothing to get the terrorists. But it can't abandon the white-collar folks, either. \r\nThere was just too much money lost too fast for what, in an era where energy seems pretty plentiful, couldn't possibly, in retrospect, be considered a real shortage. \r\nRandom musings: See you on CNBC'S \"Squawk,\" where I will, if given the chance, talk about Viacom (VIA^B:NYSE - news - commentary) , ChevronTexaco (CVX:NYSE - news - commentary) , United Technologies (UTX:NYSE - news - commentary) and Wells Fargo (WFC:NYSE - news - commentary) , all of which have some nice cyclicality to them, which is what is called for at this very moment. \r\n\r\n\r\nSmall-Stock Focus: Russell 2000 Ekes Out Increase; Adtran, Arris Group Post Gains\r\nBy Karen Talley\r\nDow Jones Newswires\r\n\r\n10/25/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nC6\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK -- It was a day for small-cap stocks to hug the baseline -- barely moving -- before ending the day with a slight gain as a number of positive profit reports pitched them onto positive ground. \r\nThe Russell 2000 Index of small-capitalization stocks rose 0.28 point, or 0.07%, to 427.65, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 27.10, or 1.59%, to 1731.54.\r\nGiven small caps' modest advance, their finishing the day higher hardly was guaranteed. For a while, in fact, they trailed larger-cap technology issues and blue chips, although there were moments when these stocks, too, slipped into negative territory. \r\nThe day offered little anthrax news but lots of earnings reports, and investors voted according to whether their companies had done well or not. \r\nGenerally for small caps, \"It's `where do we go from here' time,\" said Andrew Rich, small-cap portfolio manager with Driehaus Capital Management. A lot of small caps have recouped the ground they lost the first week the market reopened after the terrorist attacks, but there are few compelling reasons to be an aggressive buyer, Mr. Rich said. \"Now, it seems the whole market is looking for direction.\" \r\nOn the Nasdaq, volume was 1.865 billion shares, with 1.321 billion advancing and 516 million declining. Gainers outpaced decliners by 1,902 to 1,628. \r\nIt was tech all the way among the day's top performers. \r\nCommunications technology, including a lot of fiber-optic and networking firms, ranked highest. Among small caps, Adtran rose 97 cents, or 4.2%, to 23.97, Arris Group jumped 75 cents, or 19%, to 4.60 and Extreme Networks added 93 cents, or 7.6%, to 13.17. \r\nSemiconductors were the session's second-best presenters with, among small caps, Elantec Semiconductor adding 3.71, or 12%, to 34.15, and Oak Technology rising 86 cents, or 11%, to 8.80. \r\nWireless-communications stocks were also strong, with help from large-cap Nextel Communications, which advanced 1.29, or 17%, to 8.69 after posting a third-quarter loss that surpassed Wall Street estimates amid continued firmness in subscriber growth. In some possible spillover among small caps, AirGate PCS rose 3.28, or 6.1%, to 56.78. \r\nThe day's poorest performers were natural-gas utilities, which continued to be dragged down by large cap Enron, which fell 3.38, or 17%, to 16.41. Piedmont Natural Gas fell 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 30.63, and Peoples Energy shed 56 cents, or 1.4%, to 39.06. \r\nPegasystems jumped 1.21, or 43%, to 4.01 after a 12% rise Tuesday. The Cambridge, Mass., developer of customer-management software enjoyed an even stronger second day yesterday, following Tuesday's release of better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, beating an analyst's estimate by 10 cents a share. \r\nPinnacle Systems rose 83 cents, or 25%, to 4.20. The Mountain View, Calif., video-production-system maker had a fiscal first-quarter loss of 11 cents a share before items, beating Wall Street expectations by eight cents a share. Thomas Weisel upgraded shares to `buy' from `market perform.' \r\nSybase jumped 1.99, or 17%, to 13.50. The Emeryville, Calif., online-software developer reported 20 cents a share in earnings before items, beating Wall Street's expectations by two cents a share. \r\nIn a follow-on offering, AmeriPath gained 2.24, or 8.4%, to 29.04 after offering 4.125 million shares at $26 each. The follow-on, as is the custom, was priced at a discount to Tuesday's close of 26.80. \r\nMerger activity had a positive effect on small caps. PRI Automation jumped 3.38, or 27%, to 15.92. The Billerica, Mass., semiconductor-equipment maker signed a definitive agreement to be bought by Brooks Automation for about $380 million in stock. Under the accord, which was approved by both companies' boards, PRI shareholders will receive 0.52 Brooks share for each PRI share held. Brooks Automation fell 1.31, 3.9%, to 31.80. \r\nVysis surged 7.26, or 31%, to 30.26. The Downers Grove, Ill., genetic-disease researcher agreed to be acquired by Abbott Laboratories for $30.50 a share, or $355 million. Abbott rose 38 cents to 54.24. \r\nONI Systems dropped 1.01, or 15%, to 5.62. The San Jose, Calif., maker of fiber-optic communication equipment met analysts' third-quarter consensus estimate of 19 cents a share, excluding items, but said its fourth-quarter loss will range between 16 cents and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $40 million to $50 million, when analysts were expecting a loss of 16 cents a share, excluding items, on revenue of $50.1 million. Credit Suisse First Boston cut shares to \"buy\" from \"strong buy,\" and FAC Equities reduced the stock to \"neutral\" from \"buy.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's co-founder said yesterday. \r\nIn a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.\r\n\"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Ms. Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. \r\nPlanned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. \r\nOnly directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. \r\nMs. Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. \r\nTheir latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. \r\n\"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. \r\nThe corporate governance movement, since its beginnings in the 1970s, has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. \r\nOne example would be Enron Corp., whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Minow said. \r\n\"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here.\" \r\nTaking the corporate governance argument a step further, Ms. Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. \r\n\"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said. \r\nInstitutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. \r\n\"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,\" said Peter Gleason, vice-president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. \r\nSurveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. \"More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,\" Mr. Gleason said.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The move follows Tuesday's conference call, which was an attempt by Enron to restore investor confidence in the company.\r\n\"Andy Fastow was a very well-regarded, low profile individual at Enron, and he's been unfairly pilloried in the press,\" said John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. \"But the weight of circumstantial evidence and the material stock price decline made this inevitable.\"\r\nOlson predicted the CFO swap would improve Enron's credibility with Wall Street.\r\nA rough week\r\nEnron has been under fire since last week as questions have surfaced about its accounting practices, especially in regard to two limited partnerships created by Fastow in 1999 and since dissolved. \r\nEnron said Fastow had taken a leave of absence and that McMahon, most recently chairman and CEO of the industrial markets group and treasurer from 1998 to 2000, would take over.\r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" said Lay, in a statement.\r\nKaren Denne, a spokesperson for Enron, said numerous discussions Tuesday and Wednesday led to the decision. She said she did not know when Fastow would return. \r\nShares of Enron fell more than 17 percent Wednesday to $16.41, then fell further in late trading following the announcement, to as low as $16.18. At one point during the trading day, the shares were trading at a six-year low of $15.51. \r\nAnalysts deliver blows\r\nOlson called Tuesday's conference call a \"missed opportunity,\" saying Enron had a real opportunity to show the investing public that it had become more \"forthright and open.\"\r\n\"Unfortunately Enron is overloaded with lawyers,\" said Olson, who has not recommended the stock until recently. \"This company has been very much abused and maligned by people on Wall Street. They have some excellent businesses, and they have been carrying some losers.\" Enron has \"an excellent growth profile and tremendous profitability in their growth businesses, and excellent surplus cash flow,\" Olson said.\r\nEnron expects to generate $3 billion of cash flow this year, and with $500 million devoted to dividends and $1 billion to maintenance capital spending, the company will have $1.5 billion free.\r\nSeveral Wall Street firms cut their ratings on Enron shares Wednesday, including Prudential Securities. The firm advised clients to sell the stock, a rare recommendation. Prudential had rated the company's shares a \"hold.\" \r\n\"After much consideration, we are lowering our rating ... not because of things we know but because of things we potentially don't know about the company,\" wrote Prudential analyst Carol Coale in a note. \r\nOn Monday, Enron announced that related-party transactions within the limited partnerships are under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Several shareholder lawsuits have subsequently been filed.\r\n\"Management used the SEC inquiry as a shield to avoid elaboration on the issue at hand, the LJM transactions,\" Coale said in reference to the conference call. \r\nOlson said it's unlikely that Enron, with its coterie of lawyers, would allow the creation of illegal investment vehicles, but as to whether it was \"right,\" he conceded it was probably not.\r\nJ.P. Morgan's Anatol Feygin downgraded his rating to \"long-term buy\" from \"buy,\" saying an upgrade is precluded until the company provides more information about its liabilities. \r\n\"Management's conference call yesterday was a missed opportunity to disclose the necessary information to assuage investor concerns,\" Feygin wrote. \r\nMerrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey noted Wednesday that if Enron isn't able to maintain its investment-grade ratings -- the company's debt is on watch for a potential downgrade by Moody's Investors Service -- issuing new equity would be one course of action, though with the potential to reduce earnings-per-share. Enron on Tuesday held with its forecast of $1.80 a share for 2001. \r\n\"New equity would potentially dilute our EPS estimates 5 to 10 percent,\" Eassey wrote in a follow-up to the conference call. \r\nBut Eassey believes that cash flow from operations -- expected to exceed $3 billion in 2002 -- along with asset sales, should be enough to \"insulate\" the company's credit ratings.\r\nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSA: UPDATE 1-Beleaguered Enron names new CFO.\r\nBy Jeff Franks\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nReuters English News Service\r\n(C) Reuters Limited 2001.\r\n\r\nHOUSTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. , trying to halt a freefall in its stock price and a firestorm of criticism from Wall Street, named a new chief financial officer on Wednesday to replace Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators. \r\nThe company, which is the nation's largest energy trader, said Fastow would take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jeff McMahon, who has been running an Enron unit and is the company's former treasurer, in a bid to restore credibility with investors.\r\nFastow's departure follows the August resignation of chief executive Jeff Skilling, who said he wanted a change in lifestyle after just six months on the job. \r\nWednesday's change came after Enron's stock fell $3.38 to $16.41, its lowest point in six years, to cap off a $13 billion plunge in market value since the company announced a third quarter loss last week and wrote down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in a move related to the questionable transactions. \r\nWall Street's anxieties about Enron spread to the stocks of other natural gas and power traders and marketers on Wednesday, with Dynegy Inc. falling 12.8 percent to $37.26 and Aquila Inc. off 11.7 percent at $21.20. \r\nInvestors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. \r\nWall Street analysts who once touted the company have bitterly accused it of not being forthcoming about the matter, a problem Enron chief executive Ken Lay cited in his appointment of McMahon. \r\n\"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,\" he said in a statement. \r\nMcMahon, who was treasurer from 1998 to 2000 before becoming chief executive officer of Enron's Industrial Markets group, has a \"deep and thorough understanding of Enron\" and the confidence of the investment world, Lay said. \r\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that it was McMahon who first spoke up about the perception of impropriety in the limited partnership arrangements made by Fastow. The paper this week said Skilling saw no problem with it, which led McMahon, 40, to ask for a job change. \r\nFastow has denied any wrongdoing, but has been limited in his ability to speak about the issues because of the SEC investigation and shareholder lawsuits now pending against the company. \r\nAs recently as a year ago, Enron had a stellar image as a corporate innovator with a Midas touch. Its profits and stock price soared as it transformed from a natural gas pipeline company to a high-tech money machine creating new Internet-based trading markets in a wide range of commodities. \r\nBut some of its new businesses faded, a large investment in an Indian power plant went sour, the California power crises spooked investors, and then Skilling stunned the financial community with his sudden resignation. \r\nThere also was grousing from investors that Enron's earnings statements had become convoluted to the point of incomprehensibility. \r\nAnalysts said the replacement of Fastow was a step in the right direction for Enron, but not a panacea for its credibility problems. \r\n\"The problems investors are having with Enron are related to a lack of understanding of all these partnership arrangements. Changing the CFO by itself doesn't really address those concerns,\" said Mike Heim at A.G. Edwards. \r\n\"I don't think anyone has a full understanding of the extent of the liabilities Enron might have with these partnerships,\" he said. \"I still have a lot of questions.\" \r\nAndre Meade at Commerzbank Securities said Fastow's departure was not unexpected, but not that helpful. \r\n\"Investors are not going to see this as a huge move that clears up the picture,\" he said. \"Frankly, Ken Lay and the board don't have clean hands when it comes to these transactions.\" \r\n\"The fear driving the market is: if this is what we know, how much worse can it get?\" said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Closest was Dynegy Inc. which closed with a loss of $5.45, or 12.76 percent, at $37.26 - its lowest price in three weeks. \r\nPOWER EARNINGS FORECASTS TRIMMED \r\nThe talk of lower estimates of 2002 earnings from power production and trading came from four companies active in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest - American Electric Power Co. Inc. , Exelon Corp. , Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. and PPL Corp. . \r\nEarly Wednesday, PPL said it now sees little, if any, change in earnings per share next year from this year, citing expectations of lower profits on power sales in Maine, Pennsylvania and Montana. The company also confirmed it still sees 2001 earnings exceeding $4.00 per share. \r\nNoting PPL's previous 2002 guidance was $4.55 to $4.65 per share, Wachovia Securities analyst Thomas Hamlin lowered the stock's rating to \"market perform\" from \"strong buy\" explaining PPL's \"failure to differentiate itself from the power producing price takers has hurt management's credibility. \r\n\"The company will need to prove its risk management capabilities in order to be afforded a multiple in line with our higher rated Merchant Power stocks,\" he concluded. \r\nDeutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Lehman Brothers made similar downgrades in Exelon after its first 2002 guidance trailed analyst expectations. \r\nSTOCK LOSSES FOLLOW OUTLOOK CHANGES \r\n\"The primary driver (for the 2002 estimate) is lower wholesale commodity price assumptions at (the company's generation unit), in addition to weaker distribution demand\" at Exelon's utility subsidiaries in Philadelphia and Chicago, Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown analyst James Dobson wrote Tuesday. \r\nExelon officials noted, in answer to analyst questions, that the view of 2002 demand had changed to negative from flat since the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. \r\nThe company's stock, which opened 10 percent lower - at $40 - following the earnings release early Tuesday steadied to close at $41.80. The shares continued to advance Wednesday when its 12-cent rise made it one of four gainers among the 40 S&P Utility Index components. \r\nThe big loser among the integrated utilities - those which produce and distribute power - was PPL, which ended the day at $32 - down $1.68, or 4.99 percent. \r\nLosses of about 1.3 percent were posted by AEP, which closed at $42.59, down 55 cents for the day, and PSEG, which slipped 52 cents to $39.48. \r\nAEP \"management cautioned that the slowing economy may make the upper end (of its 2002 earnings guidance of $3.80 to $3.90) more difficult to achieve,\" Lehman Brothers analyst Daniel Ford wrote in a note that maintained his estimate. \r\nHe lowered his estimate of PSEG 2002 earnings per share 5 cents to $4.05 while awaiting the closing of a Peruvian purchase and pointed out it receives more for electricity than most PJM power producers because of restraints on the delivery of Midwest electricity to New Jersey's power hungry markets.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(\"Enron\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: ENE) and its principal officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through and including October 18, 2001, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). \r\nThe complaint alleges that Enron and its principal officers and directors violated Section 10(b) and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of l934 and SEC Rule 10b-5. The complaint alleges that defendants misled investors (1) by reporting assets that were overvalued by more than $1 billion, which caused writedowns in that amount and are expected to lead to further writeoffs of hundreds of millions of dollars, (2) by concealing facts regarding relationships with a related entity that led to a more than $1 billion reduction of shareholders' equity and a $35 million charge, and (3) by obfuscating or failing to disclose the fact that agreements with other related entities satisfaction of which include obligations that may require the Company to issue large amounts of its shares. This misconduct caused the market prices of Enron stock to be artificially inflated during the Class Period. When facts about these matters were disclosed at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Company's per share stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the Company's stock despite the precurietous fall in its market price. Also, Enron's senior debt was placed on notice by Moody's for possible downgrade.\r\nAlso, an SEC inquiry into the Company's transactions with related entities has been announced, and the Company revealed that its Chief Financial Officer, who is one of the Defendants, has taken a \"leave of absence\" from the Company, and has been replaced. \r\nIf you purchased Enron securities during the period from March 30, 2000 through October 18, 2001, inclusive, you may, no later than December 21, 2001 move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

Enron\r\nagreed to renegotiate the terms of the transaction to let LJM2 buy\r\nthe shares two months early.\r\n\r\n    That let the partnership earn a $10.5 million in profit, the\r\nsuit says. If the transaction had not been renegotiated, the\r\npartnership would have lost $8 for every share it sold in\r\nSeptember, the suit alleges.\r\n\r\n                           `Bailed Out'\r\n\r\n     ``Mr. Fastow and LJM2 took advantage of inside information to\r\nreap illicit insider trading profits, in the millions of dollars\r\nin this transaction alone,'' the suit says.\r\n\r\n     At the same time that the LJM2 transaction was being\r\nrenegotiated in December and January, Chief Executive Officer\r\nKenneth Lay, President Mark Frevert and other top managers sold\r\nthe $73 million in shares, the suit alleges.\r\n\r\n     Enron executives ``bailed out of shares... reaping huge\r\ninsider trading profits,'' the lawsuit says.\r\n\r\n     Other sellers included former CEO Jeff Skilling, Chief\r\nStrategy Officer Cliff Baxter, broadband services CEO Ken Rice,\r\nChief of Staff Steve Kean, pipeline group CEO Stanley Horton and\r\nChief Risk Officer Richard Buy, the suit says.\r\n\r\n     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the\r\nlawsuit.\r\n\r\n     ``We haven't been served (notice of the suit), and it's our\r\npolicy not to talk about pending litigation,'' she said\r\n\r\n     In March, spokesman Mark Palmer said the executives exercised\r\nstock options that would have expired worthless otherwise.\r\n\r\n     Enron has formed at least 18 affiliated companies to buy and\r\nsell company assets, according to records from the Texas secretary\r\nof state. The Houston-based company reported $1.01 billion in\r\nthird-quarter losses, including $35 million from the LJM\r\npartnerships run by Fastow.\r\n\r\n                            SEC Inquiry\r\n\r\n     Greenberg says directors shouldn't have allowed Fastow to run\r\npartnerships that bought and sold company assets.\r\n\r\n     Shares of Enron have fallen 52 percent in the past six days\r\non investor concern about the liabilities attached to partnerships\r\nand affiliated companies formed by Enron to remove debt from its\r\nbooks.

Third-quarter losses of $1.01 billion from failed\r\ninvestments outside the main commodities trading business wiped\r\nout 70 percent of the profit earned in the past four quarters.\r\n\r\n     ``Investors were clearly not comfortable with exposure to\r\nAndy,'' said J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin, who downgraded\r\nEnron to ``long-term buy'' today and owns no shares.\r\n\r\n     As Enron treasurer, McMahon complained to then-Enron\r\nPresident Jeffrey Skilling about potential conflicts of interest\r\nposed by the Fastow partnerships in 1999, the Wall Street Journal\r\nreported yesterday. Rebuffed, McMahon secured a reassignment, the\r\nJournal said, citing people familiar with the matter.\r\n\r\n     ``McMahon was made famous under Skilling by going to him and\r\nobjecting to the partnerships,'' Feygin said. ``For that, he was\r\ntransferred out of the treasurer function into Enron Net Works,''\r\nwhich oversees Enron's Internet trading system.\r\n\r\n                       `An Outstanding Job'\r\n\r\n     Fastow, 39 years old, ran LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,\r\ntwo partnerships created by Enron to buy company assets. Enron's\r\ninvolvement in the financing vehicles cost the company $35 million\r\nin third-quarter losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares\r\nfrom LJM2 at a cost of $1.2 billion to unwind its investment.\r\n\r\n     On a conference call yesterday, Lay said that ``I and Enron's\r\nboard of directors continue to have the highest faith and\r\nconfidence in Andy and think he's doing an outstanding job as\r\nCFO.''\r\n\r\n      Enron announced that Fastow would leave after its stock\r\nclosed down $3.38, or 17 percent, to $16.41 in today's trading.\r\n\r\n      The SEC began an inquiry into Enron's partnerships Monday.\r\nSpokeswoman Karen Denne said it is an informal inquiry that Enron\r\nis cooperating with, and that no subpoenas have been received.\r\n\r\n     The company has formed at least 18 affiliated partnerships\r\nand corporations, some of which buy and sell Enron assets such as\r\npower plants, records at the Texas secretary of state's office\r\nindicate.\r\n\r\n     The Texas records list dozens of Enron executives as officers\r\nand directors of company-related partnerships. None of them have\r\nany financial interest in the partnerships after Fastow severed\r\nties to the LJM partnerships in July, Palmer said.\r\n\r\n                        `Zero Compensation'\r\n\r\n     ``The managers in these affiliates listed as managing members\r\nare representational in nature only,'' he said. ``They get zero\r\ncompensation.''\r\n\r\n     The LJM partnerships were different. Enron's board allowed\r\nFastow, who has worked for the company for 11 years, to run them\r\nand earn as much as 2 percent annually on the amounts invested,\r\nthe Wall Street Journal reported last week. A lawsuit filed by a\r\nshareholder objecting to the arrangement said the partnerships\r\nreworked an agreement with Enron to avoid taking big losses.\r\n\r\n     Enron is obligated to repay $3.3 billion associated with two\r\nother partnerships, Marlin and Whitewing, if they can't raise\r\nenough money from asset sales to pay off the balance, Enron\r\nspokesman Mark Palmer said. Palmer said ``maybe, maybe not'' when\r\nasked if the partnerships will generate enough cash.\r\n\r\n     ``The concern now isn't just with the LJM partnership, it's\r\nmore with the other partnerships, such as Osprey and Marlin,''\r\nsaid A.G. Edwards analyst Mike Heim, who has a ``hold'' rating on\r\nEnron and owns no shares.\r\n\r\n                       High Level Departures\r\n\r\n     Enron has lost several senior executives in the past two\r\nyears. CEO Skilling resigned in August after seven months on the\r\njob, citing personal reasons and frustration with declines in the\r\ncompany's stock price. Enron Corp. Vice Chairman Joseph W. Sutton\r\nleft the company in November as the company switched its focus\r\nfrom developing assets to energy and commodity trading.\r\n\r\n     Rebecca Mark, one of the highest-ranking women in U.S.\r\nbusiness, quit August 2000 as chairman and chief executive of\r\nAzurix Corp., a water company formed by Enron Corp. Mark also\r\nresigned from Enron's board.\r\n\r\n     Azurix was a money-losing investment. Enron sold shares in\r\nthe water company to the public that it later had to buy back.\r\n\r\n--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***********\r\nEDRM Enron Email Data Set has been produced in EML, PST and NSF format by ZL Technologies, Inc.

The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.\r\nMr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. \r\nHe said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. \r\n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds\" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. \"But if we are wrong, we will issue equity.\" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. \r\nMaking up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. \r\nDuring the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. \r\nThe turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while \"we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well.\" Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. \r\nMr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was \"very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about.\" He added \"we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.\" \r\nInternal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. \r\nDuring the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. \"There's the appearance you are hiding something,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. \"You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board.\" \r\nMr. Lay responded, \"We're trying to be as transparent as we can.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.\r\nBut he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. \r\nThe conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. \r\nUntil recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. \r\nOne of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. \r\nAfter the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' \r\nMr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' \r\nMr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. \r\nMr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. \r\nMr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' \r\nMr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. \r\nMr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. \r\nThe large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. \r\nAfter one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. \r\nBuyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. \r\nThe implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. \r\nThe volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. \r\nTo be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. \r\nThe news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. \r\nTuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. \r\nIt remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. \r\nDavid Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. \r\n\"I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,\" he said. \r\nLay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. \r\nHe did say Enron was aware an \"inherent conflict of interest\" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. \r\nIn response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. \r\n\"There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,\" he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. \r\nLay and Enron's board continue to have the \"highest faith and confidence\" in Fastow, he added. \r\nFastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. \r\nEnron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. \r\nIt took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. \r\nDuring the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. \r\nThey stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. \r\nIf Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. \r\nJeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. \r\n\"I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVER - Busy signal.\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\r\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved\r\n\r\nBusy signal \r\nEnron should know plenty about bandwidth.\r\nThrough Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about \"developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels\". \r\nBut there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to \"address investor concerns\" about its financial dealings. \r\nDespite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. \r\nThose investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on. \r\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. \r\nEnron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.\r\nThe report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. \r\nAccording to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes.

Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. \r\nShares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. \r\nPower utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. \r\nNevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. \r\n\"Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market,\" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. \"Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it.\" \r\nSome seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. \r\nWhatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. \r\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. \r\nInvestors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. \r\nConsumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. \r\nThere were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. \r\nVitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. \r\nNetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. \r\nChartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. \r\nShares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. \r\nEarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. \r\nAT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. \r\nSeveral steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. \r\nMcKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. \r\nWatson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. \r\nFurniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.\r\nA copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. \r\nAES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. \r\nAES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. \r\nIn his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the \"expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management\" by the state government and its agencies.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. \r\nSTOP AND THINK \r\nThe world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. \r\nGolar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. \r\n\"There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered,\" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, \"The only risk is things might be delayed.\" \r\nStohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. \r\nGolar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. \r\n\"We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,\" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. \r\nHe said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. \r\n\"It's a good time to wait,\" said Saverys.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. \r\nONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd.

Reliance and ONGC, which together own 70\r\npercent of the exploration venture, have both claimed rights to\r\nrun the oil and gas fields.\r\n\r\n     BG has asked ONGC to waive its right to decide the operator\r\nafter Enron quits in return for a stake in its oil and gas sites\r\nin Brazil, the paper said. It didn't give details on the Brazilian\r\ninterests BG may offer ONGC. BG has set Oct. 31 as a deadline to\r\nresolve the ownership dispute, the paper said.\r\n\r\n     The purchase from Enron would give BG a 30 percent stake in\r\nthe Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63\r\npercent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The\r\nassets hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas.\r\n\r\n     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian\r\npartners, ONGC and Reliance, as well as from the nation's biggest\r\nrefiner, Indian Oil Corp.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse stimulus bill would give billions to huge companies; Senate Democrats present alternative\r\nBy CURT ANDERSON\r\nAP Tax Writer\r\n\r\n10/23/2001\r\nAssociated Press Newswires\r\nCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals. \r\nSeven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits.\r\nIBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chain Kroger, $9 million. \r\nIn addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that could total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million. \r\nCounting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief over 10 years. \r\nThe generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly. \r\n\"It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is,\" said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. \r\nFor individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than under the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier. \r\nThe primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation \"is a shot of adrenaline\" that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation. \r\n\"Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy,\" wrote Thomas, R-Calif. \r\nWhile bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid. \r\nThe legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2002, far below the House GOP level. \r\n\"This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly,\" said Baucus, D-Mont. \r\nOther Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines. \r\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending. \r\n\"Everything in this package needs to be stimulative,\" Grassley said. \"There needs to be more done on the investment side.\" \r\n--- \r\nOn the Net: House members: http://www.house.gov/house/MemberWWW.html\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

So and I`m only investing a little bit every month in it but you think that`s pretty wise idea just kind of keep on doing small investments? \r\nLUSKIN: Well as a general investing strategy yes but Enron is a special case where we have a company that`s in bad trouble. We had a CEO who basically left without explanation a couple of months ago, then yesterday the CFO has been accused of some pretty strange looking self dealing issues. We don`t know how that`s going to resolve but this is a company under a cloud so you might want to hold off on your buying program until that cloud lifts a little bit. \r\nFRANCIS: All right Don, thank you very much; we appreciate it.

The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes\r\nare currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the\r\nplacing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by\r\nFitch.\r\n\r\nThe rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund\r\naccount (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron\r\nin the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The\r\noverfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated\r\n'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service\r\ninterest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies\r\non Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible\r\npreferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred\r\nsecurities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the\r\ntransaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan\r\nto Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the\r\nsupport from the assets in the share trust used to support\r\ninterest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to\r\nremarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund\r\nprincipal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock\r\nhas been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets\r\nin the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron\r\nunsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as\r\nquarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible\r\npreferred stock.\r\n\r\nWhile various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or\r\nliquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in\r\neach case primary credit support is derived from the Enron\r\nobligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock\r\nif an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been\r\ndeposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity\r\ndate, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that\r\nthe issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount\r\nrequired to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to\r\ndeliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver\r\non this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then\r\nthe amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of\r\nEnron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note\r\nTrigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured\r\ndebt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies\r\nin conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock\r\nprice over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary\r\nevents of default under the notes. It is important to note that\r\nEnron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate\r\nmarket value to fully pay down the associated debt.\r\n\r\nFitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction\r\nwith the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as\r\nappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans\r\n\r\n10/26/2001\r\nCapital Markets Report\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted \r\nlower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to \r\ndraw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities.\r\nLate Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the \r\nfinancial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed \r\nlines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.\r\nEnron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 \r\ncents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday.\r\nTrading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as \r\nactive as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than \r\ninvestment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday \r\nfor Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above \r\ndistressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank \r\ndebt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was \r\nnegotiated several months ago.\r\nThat was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, \r\nthe company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion \r\nreduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities \r\nand Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did \r\nwith Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced \r\non Wednesday.\r\nMoody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, \r\nthough it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & \r\nPoor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on \r\nreview for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to \r\nnegative from stable.\r\nEnron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 \r\np.m. EDT.\r\nAmong the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion \r\n364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 \r\nbillion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan \r\nPricing Corp. in New York.\r\nOne distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low \r\ncoupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate.\r\nBanks, the investor said, \"are funding it and not getting paid for the risk \r\nat Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02,\" the investor said.\r\nAnother fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the \r\ntires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or \r\ninvestment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below \r\ninvestment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are \r\nLucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX)\r\n\"As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it \r\nreally changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off \r\ntheir books,\" this person said.\r\nSome banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that \r\nbanks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven.\r\n\"Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that,\" the \r\nfixed income official said.\r\n\r\n-By Joe Niedzielski, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-2039; \r\njoe.niedzielski@dowjones.com\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE), he threw out a ray \r\nof hope for his company's foundering broadband business.\r\nEnron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide \r\nbandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, \r\nSkilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.\r\nAfter three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its \r\nsilence by suing Microsoft.\r\nIn a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, \r\nEnron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal.\r\nThe agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and \r\nprovide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering \r\nof high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit.\r\nMicrosoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system \r\nfor use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase \r\nof the deal, according to the lawsuit.\r\nMicrosoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the \r\ndeal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for \r\nthe deal, the lawsuit said.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't \r\nprovide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have \r\nbreached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to \r\nrecover damages.\r\nThe suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth \r\nforecast required by the deal.\r\nIn a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public \r\nannouncements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's \r\nprior approval.\r\nAn Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press \r\nrelease Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the \r\nrelease.\r\nA Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN \r\n7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, \r\naccess to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25.\r\nThe Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver \"state-of-the-art\" video and \r\naudio through \"dramatically improved\" broadband technology. The new service \r\nwould extend MSN broadband service \"to more than 29 million households in 45 \r\nmarkets.\"\r\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN \r\nbroadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households \r\ncapable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access.\r\nThe Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It \r\nalso asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as \r\ncosts stemming from the lawsuit.\r\nNeither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the \r\nlawsuit.\r\nThe Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, \r\nEnron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal \r\nto deliver movies over the Internet.\r\nThat deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's \r\nfiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. \r\nEnron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity \r\nof movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service.\r\n-By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; \r\nmichael.rieke@dowjones.com\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The sales unit had failed to meet \r\nbonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group \r\nitself from unpaid bills.\r\nISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New \r\nEngland states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to \"initiate \r\ntermination proceedings\" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a \r\nletter obtained by the Globe.\r\nAn Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's \r\nrequirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of \r\nadministrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn \r\nEnron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels.\r\n\"It was an administrative snafu,\" said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for \r\nEnron. \"It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on \r\ntime] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on \r\nFriday.\"\r\nAccording to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has \r\nfailed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 \r\nmonths. \"Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen \r\nfrequently,\" said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the \r\nletter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization \r\n\"has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone \r\ncommunications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured.\"\r\nBut Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous \r\n\"financial assurance\" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. \r\nTherefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was \r\nthe third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the \r\ncurrent default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that \r\nresulted in the letter. \"We're working with ISO New England to figure that \r\nout,\" she said.\r\nThe recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's \r\ndirector of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman \r\nof Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major \r\nmembership meetings in the organization.\r\n\"This is not that unusual within the pool,\" said Allegretti. \"I frequently \r\nreceive notices of technical defaults.\" As far as posting the new bond to \r\ncorrect the situation, he said, \"We were two and a half days late in \r\nsubmitting paperwork.\"\r\nThe incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The \r\nparent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the \r\nfirm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting \r\nfrom partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of \r\ntransactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing \r\nthose transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave \r\nTuesday and installed a new CFO.\r\nEnron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships \r\nand their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced \r\nshareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of \r\nthe partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall \r\nStreet Journal. Enron lost $618 million in the third quarter.\r\nYesterday, Enron's shares closed at $16.35, down 6 cents, on volume of 39.1 \r\nmillion shares.\r\nJeffrey Krasner can be reached by e-mail at krasner@globe.com.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nFRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell \r\ncritics' concerns\r\nFinancial Times; Oct 26, 2001\r\nBy JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY\r\n\r\nEnron has put up a page on its website of \"frequently asked questions\" in \r\nresponse to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's \r\ncontroversial results announcement.\r\nUnfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with \r\nthe answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its \r\nchief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly \r\ncomplex financial affairs.\r\nHowever, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is \r\ndistancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing \r\nvehicle \"partnerships\". \"It is a step in the right direction and we are \r\nhappy to see them move,\" says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. \"It's not the \r\nend of it.\"\r\nThe shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade \r\nlower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that \r\nthe shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars \r\n84.87 until the group improves its transparency.\r\nOne of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement \r\non October 16 concerned \"a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in \r\nshareholders' equity\". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news \r\nrelease on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up \r\nconference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in \r\nthe earnings report.\r\nIt has since been called a \"loss\" and a \"write-off\" and Enron's staff have \r\nstruggled to explain it in plain language.\r\nEnron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity \r\nrelated to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund \r\nformed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to \r\nterminate these vehicles, Enron \"recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in \r\nshareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These \r\nadjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver \r\nEnron shares in future periods\".\r\nThe confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility \r\nof Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the \r\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\r\nAnalysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and \r\nnote that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might \r\nhurt its debt rating.\r\nMr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not \r\ntransparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside \r\nauditors to explain its accounts. \"I find the disclosure is not complete \r\nenough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these \r\ntransactions,\" said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer.\r\nOther analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. \r\nSalomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its \r\nDabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining \r\ntelecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of \r\nEnron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles.\r\n\"Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to \r\nevaluate whether there is a problem with them,\" Mr Niles says. Other US \r\nenergy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso \r\nsaid it was facing \"a lot of questions on its accounting practices\".\r\nAdditional reporting by Julie Earle Enron in turmoil: www.ft.com/enron\r\nCopyright: The Financial Times Limited\r\n\r\n\r\nEnron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)\r\n2001-10-26 14:26 (New York)\r\n\r\nEnron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)\r\n\r\n     (Adds Egan-Jones lowering credit rating in 12th paragraph.)\r\n\r\n     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares\r\nfell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond\r\nrating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit line\r\nbecause it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.\r\n\r\n     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after\r\ninvestors questioned the company's transactions with affiliated\r\ncompanies run by its former chief financial officer. The stock\r\nfell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.\r\n\r\n     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''\r\nsaid John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed income\r\nassets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who was\r\nsupposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was\r\nrunning partnerships for the benefit of himself.''\r\n\r\n     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-\r\nterm loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company will\r\nuse its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it\r\nhas outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.\r\n\r\n      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009\r\ndeclined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an\r\noffer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating\r\nof ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.\r\n\r\n     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that\r\nthe company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in\r\nthird-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good\r\ncredit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding\r\ncollateral and to settle transactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Dilution Concerns\r\n\r\n     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their\r\nyield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds\r\nthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies\r\nwith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\n     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back\r\nholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value\r\nof Enron investors' stock.\r\n\r\n     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron\r\nassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to\r\nthe partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. The\r\npartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the\r\nassets.\r\n\r\n     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money\r\ncomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find\r\nthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would\r\nhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell\r\nfor and the amount of the debt.\r\n\r\n     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron\r\npreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would\r\nthin out the holding of every other investor.\r\n\r\n     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's Investors\r\nService has the company on watch for possible downgrade, and\r\nStandard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to\r\nnegative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating on\r\nEnron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.\r\n\r\n                         Other Liabilities\r\n\r\n     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts\r\nto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.\r\n\r\n     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on\r\nWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a\r\npartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct\r\nlosses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the\r\npartnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.\r\n\r\n     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was\r\nnamed CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and\r\nChief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.\r\n\r\n--Mark Johnson in the Princeton newsroom (609) 750-4662, or at\r\n50-4662, or at\r\n\r\n\r\nWeiss & Yourman Law Office Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron \r\nCorp.\r\n\r\n10/26/2001\r\nBusiness Wire\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--A class action lawsuit against \r\nEnron Corp. (\"Enron\" or the \"Company\")(NYSE:ENE) and certain of its officers \r\nand directors was commenced in the United States District Court for the \r\nSouthern District of Texas, Houston Division, on behalf of purchasers of \r\nEnron securities. If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 \r\nand October 17, 2001, please read this notice.\r\nThe complaint charges the defendants with violations of the Securities \r\nExchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to \r\ndisclose material adverse information and misrepresented the truth about the \r\nCompany and caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase \r\nEnron common stock at artificially inflated prices.\r\nThis action seeks to recover damages on behalf of defrauded investors who \r\npurchased Enron securities. Plaintiff is represented by Weiss & Yourman, a \r\nlaw firm possessing significant experience and expertise in prosecuting \r\nclass actions on behalf of defrauded shareholders in federal and state \r\ncourts throughout the United States. Weiss & Yourman has been appointed by \r\nnumerous courts to serve as lead counsel in class action lawsuits and in \r\nthat capacity has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of \r\ninvestors.\r\nIf you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, \r\n2001, you may move the Court no later than December 21, 2001, to serve as a \r\nlead plaintiff of the class. In order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must \r\nmeet certain legal requirements. A lead plaintiff is a representative party \r\nthat acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In \r\norder to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the \r\nclass member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and \r\nthat the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain \r\ncircumstances, one or more class members may together serve as \"lead \r\nplaintiff.\" Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected \r\nby the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain \r\nWeiss & Yourman or other counsel of your choice to serve as your counsel in \r\nthis action.\r\nIf you wish to receive an investor package or if you wish to discuss this \r\naction, have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or \r\ninterests with respect to this matter, or if you have any information you \r\nwish to provide to us, pleas\r\n\r\n\r\ncontact:\r\nMark D.

Emshwiller\r\nStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nThe Wall Street Journal\r\nA2\r\n(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)\r\n\r\nEnron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or \r\nmore during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment \r\nvehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing \r\nadditional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.\r\nHowever, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the \r\ncompany believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by \r\nthose investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. \r\nThe notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities --  \r\nknown as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the \r\nOsprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 \r\nmonths.\r\nMr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of \r\nthe notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those \r\ntransactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are \r\nguaranteed by Enron.\r\nHe said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the \r\nend of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from \r\nthe previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility \r\nunit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002.\r\n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient \r\nproceeds\" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. \"But if we are wrong, we will \r\nissue equity.\" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing \r\nas much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares \r\noutstanding.\r\nMaking up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the \r\ndrop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite \r\ntrading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again \r\none of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. \r\nEarly this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share.\r\nDuring the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more \r\nthan 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, \r\nresulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a \r\n$1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of \r\nterminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time \r\nwas headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. \r\nFastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing \r\nconcerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that \r\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions \r\nrelated to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were \r\nproper.\r\nThe turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference \r\ncall yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to \r\nreassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said \r\nwhile \"we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our \r\nbusinesses are performing very well.\" Mr. Lay and other executives said \r\nEnron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs.\r\nMr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. \r\nBut neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the \r\nFastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. \r\nLay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership \r\narrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts \r\nand others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason \r\nnot to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was \"very \r\nconcerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about.\" He \r\nadded \"we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.\"\r\nInternal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of \r\nfellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and \r\ncapital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron \r\nassets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to \r\nEnron SEC filings.\r\nDuring the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime \r\nEnron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement \r\nand the company's often opaque financial reports. \"There's the appearance \r\nyou are hiding something,\" said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. \"You \r\nneed to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your \r\ndealings are above board.\"\r\nMr. Lay responded, \"We're trying to be as transparent as we can.\"\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Lay, strongly \r\ndefended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no \r\nconflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and \r\nExchange Commission was looking into.\r\nBut he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with \r\npartnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In \r\naddition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to \r\nhave sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer \r\nany questions about it.\r\nThe conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York \r\nStock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes \r\nof the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon \r\nbegan falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of \r\n$19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the \r\nhigh set by the stock in the summer of 2000.\r\nUntil recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating \r\nearnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy \r\nmarkets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some \r\ninvolving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships \r\ncontrolled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder \r\nequity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the \r\ncompany disclosed on Monday.\r\nOne of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an \r\nanalyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that \r\nEnron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance \r\nthat you are hiding something,'' he said.\r\nAfter the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in \r\na number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to \r\nunderstand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming \r\nin explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still \r\nrecommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have \r\nallowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans \r\ngoing on at this company, there is tremendous value here.''\r\nMr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on \r\nthe transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. \r\nFastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to \r\nhave the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''\r\nMr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed \r\nEnron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, \r\ncalled Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary \r\nthat owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined \r\nthere is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard \r\nGrubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm.\r\nMr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was \r\nguaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting \r\nthat Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public \r\nshareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, \r\nMr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its \r\nexposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up \r\nbeing satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares.\r\nMr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. \r\nEventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock \r\nprice down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But \r\nlet's move on to the next question.''\r\nMr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper \r\nand had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by \r\n$3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire \r\nnext May if it is not renewed.\r\nMr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when \r\nhis brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a \r\nconference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction \r\nwould have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with \r\nthe earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider \r\nreleasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no \r\npromises.\r\nThe large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, \r\nand so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of \r\nthe sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be \r\neffectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is \r\nexpected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was \r\ncorrect.\r\nAfter one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron \r\nif it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that \r\nwere set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the \r\ncompany ''will look into providing'' such statements.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Contrarians believe the CBOE \r\nequity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the \r\nsession's end, the ratio was at 0.49.\r\nBuyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet \r\nswitching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at \r\nLetco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands \r\nof January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 \r\nshares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq \r\nStock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 \r\ncalls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while \r\n6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange.\r\nThe implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as \r\nthe energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their \r\nconcerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is \r\nlooking at the Houston company.\r\nThe volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to \r\nsell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and \r\nexpiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer \r\nrich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at \r\nMiller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New \r\nYork Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would \r\nearn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset \r\nthe cost of buying stock.\r\nTo be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the \r\nstock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in \r\neither direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy \r\nstraddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers \r\npocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tuesday \r\nit dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79.\r\nThe news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall \r\nStreet that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand \r\nand that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its \r\nperformance.\r\nTuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for \r\ninvestors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of \r\nquestions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result.\r\nDavid Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's \r\ncredibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything \r\nin his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard.\r\n\"I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand \r\nand explain all the intricacies of all those transactions,\" he said.\r\nLay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships \r\nbecause of the SEC inquiry.\r\nHe did say Enron was aware an \"inherent conflict of interest\" would result \r\nfrom its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing \r\nbusiness with Enron.\r\nIn response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously \r\nfollowed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised.\r\n\"There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron,\" he said, adding that Enron \r\nwasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in \r\nEnron's best interest.\r\nLay and Enron's board continue to have the \"highest faith and confidence\" in \r\nFastow, he added.\r\nFastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from \r\nWall Street.\r\nEnron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships.\r\nIt took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' \r\nequity by $1.2 billion as a result.\r\nDuring the call Enron executives also addressed other issues.\r\nThey stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to \r\ncarry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, \r\nWhitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in \r\ncertain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the \r\ninvestments.\r\nIf Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, \r\ncommitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps \r\nthat would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become \r\ndiluted.\r\nJeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who \r\nfollows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received \r\nsome new information about Enron's lines of credit.\r\n\"I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVER - Busy signal.\r\n\r\n10/24/2001\r\nFinancial Times (U.K. edition)\r\n(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited .

A live \r\nwebcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the \r\nchance to grill Enron brass.\r\nThose investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 \r\nminutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped \r\nmid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company \r\nexecutives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share \r\nprice was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up \r\nand it was time to move on.\r\n(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Treasurer Ben Glisan said the \r\ncompany thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment \r\nvehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street \r\nJournal reported in its online edition on Wednesday.\r\nEnron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those \r\ninvestment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby \r\ndiluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.\r\nThe report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were \r\nsold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due \r\nduring the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust \r\nII, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, \r\nthe report said.\r\nAccording to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be \r\nsold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report \r\nsaid. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward \r\nrepaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron.\r\nGlisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise \r\nat least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002.\r\n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient \r\nproceeds\" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. \"But if \r\nwe are wrong, we will issue equity.\"\r\nAccording to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve \r\nissuing as much as $1 billion in stock.\r\nEnron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor \r\nconcerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions \r\ninvolving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than \r\n$10 billion in value over the past week.\r\nEnron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, \r\nsuggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing \r\nbusiness, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on \r\ncommodity prices and market hedges.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those \r\ntransactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are \r\nguaranteed by Enron.\r\nHe said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the \r\nend of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from \r\nthe previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility \r\nunit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002.\r\n\"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient \r\nproceeds\" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. \"But if we are wrong, we will \r\nissue equity.\" Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing \r\nas much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares \r\noutstanding.\r\nMaking up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the \r\ndrop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite \r\ntrading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79.

Shares of Bristol-Myers \r\nSquibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products \r\nlost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, \r\nto 38.17.\r\nShares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in \r\nreaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to \r\n69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25.\r\nPower utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after \r\nits third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from \r\nseveral analysts.\r\nNevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed \r\ncontinued reluctance to throw in the towel.\r\n\"Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the \r\nmarket,\" Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. \"Their fear \r\nis that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, \r\nwhich is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it.\"\r\nSome seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices \r\nrecently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at \r\nthe end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying \r\nstocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio --  \r\nwhile others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market.\r\nWhatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices \r\nhave risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones \r\nIndustrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points \r\nyesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08.\r\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. \r\nVolume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace.\r\nInvestors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in \r\nwhich their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. \r\nShares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished \r\nagain, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week \r\nlow of 38.20, set June 26.\r\nConsumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 \r\ncents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts \r\nof interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and \r\npartnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, \r\ndropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low \r\nintraday.\r\nThere were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose \r\n2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern \r\nreported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago \r\nperformance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts.\r\nVitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated \r\ncircuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or \r\n4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth \r\nquarter proved sharper than expected.\r\nNetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, \r\nCalif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results \r\nlate Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for.\r\nChartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The \r\nSingapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for \r\nthe period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than \r\nanalysts had projected.\r\nShares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter \r\nCommunications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, \r\nor 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. \r\nThomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC \r\nCommunications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to \r\nscale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering.\r\nEarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service \r\nprovider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also \r\nsignaled that its customer growth had slowed.\r\nAT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., \r\nprovider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results \r\nthat topped what analysts had been looking for.\r\nSeveral steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. \r\nTrade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have \r\nbeen significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the \r\nerection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 \r\ncents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel \r\nimproved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31.\r\nMcKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug \r\ndistributor and health-care information technology provider posted \r\nstronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results.\r\nWatson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its \r\nrating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings \r\nprojections for the company.\r\nFurniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating \r\non the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has \r\nlost market share to rival manufacturers.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of \r\nwhich have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas.\r\nSTOP AND THINK\r\nThe world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, \r\nhistorically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and \r\nconsider the problem.\r\nGolar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under \r\nconstruction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have \r\nfirm future employment.\r\n\"There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and \r\nthe amount of ships ordered,\" Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told \r\nReuters, \"The only risk is things might be delayed.\"\r\nStohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it \r\nwas also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of \r\nthem.\r\nGolar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more \r\ntraditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as \r\nlittle as possible to chance.\r\n\"We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under \r\noffer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender,\" Managing Director Nicolas Saverys \r\ntold Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron.\r\nHe said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production \r\nAgreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship \r\norders.\r\n\"It's a good time to wait,\" said Saverys.\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Reliance and ONGC, which together own 70\r\npercent of the exploration venture, have both claimed rights to\r\nrun the oil and gas fields.\r\n\r\n     BG has asked ONGC to waive its right to decide the operator\r\nafter Enron quits in return for a stake in its oil and gas sites\r\nin Brazil, the paper said. It didn't give details on the Brazilian\r\ninterests BG may offer ONGC. BG has set Oct. 31 as a deadline to\r\nresolve the ownership dispute, the paper said.\r\n\r\n     The purchase from Enron would give BG a 30 percent stake in\r\nthe Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63\r\npercent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The\r\nassets hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas.\r\n\r\n     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian\r\npartners, ONGC and Reliance, as well as from the nation's biggest\r\nrefiner, Indian Oil Corp.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse stimulus bill would give billions to huge companies; Senate Democrats \r\npresent alternative\r\nBy CURT ANDERSON\r\nAP Tax Writer\r\n\r\n10/23/2001\r\nAssociated Press Newswires\r\nCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that \r\nwould receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House \r\nRepublican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous \r\nto companies and does too little for individuals.\r\nSeven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative \r\nminimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House \r\nlegislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic \r\nminimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous \r\ndeductions and credits.\r\nIBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan \r\nCongressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 \r\nmillion and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds \r\ninclude energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and \r\ngrocery chain Kroger, $9 million.\r\nIn addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that \r\ncould total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million.\r\nCounting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in \r\ntax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the \r\nbill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms \r\ndoing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief \r\nover 10 years.\r\nThe generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in \r\nthe House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say \r\nthe measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush \r\nadministration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly.\r\n\"It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is,\" said Sen. John \r\nBreaux, D-La.\r\nFor individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate \r\nchecks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current \r\n27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than \r\nunder the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates \r\nfrom 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business \r\nequipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against \r\ntaxes paid five years earlier.\r\nThe primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in \r\na newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the \r\nlegislation \"is a shot of adrenaline\" that will help restart the economy \r\nwhile not triggering inflation.\r\n\"Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy,\" wrote \r\nThomas, R-Calif.\r\nWhile bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats \r\nhave been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers \r\nwho lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance \r\nCommittee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend \r\nunemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for \r\nCOBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for \r\nMedicaid.\r\nThe legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar \r\nto the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative \r\nminimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion \r\nin 2002, far below the House GOP level.\r\n\"This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this \r\nnation get back to work and recover quickly,\" said Baucus, D-Mont.\r\nOther Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations \r\nCommittee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 \r\nbillion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and \r\nfood inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more \r\nvaccines.\r\nSen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the \r\nstimulus bill laden with additional spending.\r\n\"Everything in this package needs to be stimulative,\" Grassley said. \"There \r\nneeds to be more done on the investment side.\"\r\n--- \r\nOn the Net: House members: http://www.house.gov/house/MemberWWW.html\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
